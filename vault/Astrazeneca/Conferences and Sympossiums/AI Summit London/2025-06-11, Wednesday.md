The Open vs. Closed Debate  - The next generation stage

OS 0-10 CS

**3-4 -Sondip** 
Philosophy of believe, but not trust blindely. Open source allows to audit but doesn't mean the model is always secure
*AI Regulation*
The EU acts talks about high risk and low risk models. For open source is easier to see if the model falls under which category, which is not the case with closed source models.

**3.14 - Daniel**
You get the most motivation out of the financial incentives, that is really difficult in open source 
*AI Regulation*
trade-offs between performance and bias

**5-6 - Sandeep**
- For him it depends on what are you building. 
	- If you are in the business of building model
	- If you are building products on top of models
Once you know this, you can make the choice
*AI Regulation*
He thinks it doesn't matter if it's closed or open source

**Arguments for Open Source**
- PRO: 
	- If the code is open source, that is the highest expression of innovation and collaboration
- AGAINST: 
	- Diluting the ownership, monetary strategy becomes very difficult
	- You get the most motivation out of the financial incentives, that is really difficult in open source

***AI Regulatons on the Global Stage> Navigating the Complexities of AI Regulation***

Any application in the health space will be high risks.
If new technology comes through, the legislation needs to be revised.
What is the UK opportunity in the AI space

Domain specific approach

Crisis sometimes drive the efforts into regulations

Government makes all the code public
the best thing you can do with AI is put it to the service of humanity. E.g.> help with reading letters addressed to the government and help prioritise them


The risk of AI may never be 0, but it can be way lower. Force poloicies that force people to think thoroughly before using AI.

AI in drug discovery
AI wont do our job, but it will enable scientists to experiment more

*Patty OCallaghan*
She met a doctor who was Using AI to detect Retinopatology in very early stages. But he wasn-t using the tool for diagnosis

How can we convince people
Mark>
AI for radiology, he realised they needed to have a radiologist in the team. By involving the specialists in the loop, adoption was much easier in later stages.

Bose
A very high percentage of AI projects fail because the data is not ready.
