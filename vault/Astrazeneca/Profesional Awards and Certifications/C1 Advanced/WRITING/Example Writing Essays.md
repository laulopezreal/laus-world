### Essay 1

**Prompt:**  
“In recent years, environmental concerns have become more important than economic growth. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.”

> **Introduction**  
> In recent years, the tension between environmental protection and economic expansion has become increasingly pronounced. While some argue that economic growth is the driving force behind societal progress, others maintain that preserving our planet should take precedence. This essay will examine both perspectives and explain why I believe that environmental concerns must guide future development.
> 
> **Body Paragraph 1**  
> Proponents of prioritising economic growth claim that a robust economy generates jobs, improves living standards and funds public services. For instance, during the post-2008 recovery, countries that focused on industrial output saw unemployment rates fall significantly. This suggests that a thriving economy is indispensable for individual prosperity and social stability.
> 
> **Body Paragraph 2**  
> On the other hand, advocates of environmental stewardship contend that unchecked growth leads to resource depletion and irreversible damage. A case in point is the Amazon rainforest, where deforestation for agricultural expansion has accelerated biodiversity loss. If current trends continue, essential ecosystems may collapse, undermining long-term human well-being.
> 
> **Conclusion**  
> In conclusion, although economic growth undoubtedly brings tangible benefits, I firmly believe that it should not come at the expense of the environment. Sustainable development models—such as green technologies and circular economies—offer a balanced path forward, ensuring both prosperity and the planet’s health.

### Essay 2

**Prompt:**  
“The number of people working remotely has surged. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages and give your opinion.”

> **Introduction**  
> The shift towards remote working has accelerated in recent years, especially following the global pandemic. While many applaud the flexibility it offers, critics warn of potential drawbacks. This essay will explore both sides before arguing that, on balance, remote work represents a positive development.
> 
> **Body Paragraph 1**  
> Advocates emphasise that working from home saves commuting time and increases productivity. Without a daily journey, employees often enjoy a better work–life balance, which can reduce stress. For example, a 2023 survey found that 70 percent of remote workers felt more motivated and focused in their own environment.
> 
> **Body Paragraph 2**  
> Conversely, opponents argue that remote work can lead to isolation and blurred boundaries between professional and personal life. Many report struggling to “switch off” after logging off, leading to longer working hours and burnout. In addition, informal office interactions that foster creativity and team cohesion are harder to replicate online.
> 
> **Conclusion**  
> In conclusion, while remote working presents challenges—such as potential loneliness and overwork—its advantages in flexibility and efficiency outweigh the negatives. By establishing clear policies and encouraging regular virtual or face-to-face meetups, organisations can harness the best of both worlds.

### Essay 3

**Prompt:**  
“Some people say social media enhances communication, while others believe it damages real-life relationships. Discuss both views and give your opinion.”

> **Introduction**  
> The advent of social media has revolutionised how we connect, yet its impact on genuine relationships remains contentious. Some maintain that platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp enrich communication, whereas others argue they erode face-to-face bonds. This essay will consider both viewpoints before concluding that, used responsibly, social media can complement real-life interactions.
> 
> **Body Paragraph 1**  
> Supporters contend that social media breaks down geographical barriers, enabling instant contact with friends and family worldwide. For instance, video calls on Facebook or WhatsApp allow users to share milestones in real time, fostering a sense of closeness. Moreover, interest-based online communities offer emotional support to those who might feel isolated locally.
> 
> **Body Paragraph 2**  
> Conversely, critics warn that excessive online engagement can undermine interpersonal skills. People may substitute genuine conversations with superficial “likes” or brief comments, leading to misunderstandings. A study in 2024 revealed that heavy social media users reported lower levels of empathy and found it harder to maintain eye contact during in-person meetings.
> 
> **Conclusion**  
> In conclusion, although social media poses risks to authentic communication, I believe its benefits prevail when users apply it judiciously. By setting screen-time limits and prioritising face-to-face encounters, individuals can enjoy digital connectivity without sacrificing real-world relationships.
