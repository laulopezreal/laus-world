What is the ticket for the documentation task? 

Monday 2nd September 
- [x] Take notes about meeting with Mushtaque and Jason
Problem: The compose team is unhappy with the UI json files being saved into the neo4j database. We have allocated some time this sprint to collaborate with Mushtaque and Jason and propose an alternative, that could be implemented in over the next weeks.

UI meeting on 2nd September, 2024
- Ufuk thinks that the solution might require having a document store that is accessible by the graph database (is it worth it to have a separate service running 
- Currently, the session information is saved in the local store (Browser cache), and this is a wider problem that they need to address. Moving this information away from the local store would also require having something like a document store.
- To address both issues, we at least would require:
    - A service that runs a document store
    - An API to query and interact with the document store
    - A policy to provide the right access
- Ufuk thinks that this task would require input from the Compose team, as we work more closely with the infrastructure behind the KGs
