# WONT DO Sustainability Manager (Microsoft) - SM

SM is a data management platform for **environmental socilal and governance** data
The solution that enables
- Recording: capture and record data. Enable GAP detection in data and request data to the correspondent Data Stewards.
- Reporting: in support to decision making (dashboards)
- Reduce: Suggesting measures on how to reduce  the impact for sustainability purposes.

Ramon estimates that SM would take about 8-12 weeks to be configured in AstraZeneca.

SM provides data connectors, analytical capabilities and reporting dashboards., scoreboards etc. (but my view is that this is not an advantage as Power APPs also offer these functionality)

**Advantages over  "Vanilla" Power Apps (Power BI and Power Query)**
- The Sustainability Manager data model has been tested and is used by very large organisations.
- The main advantage over vanilla Power NO is in terms Total cost of ownership and time to market
- Their engineers estimate that it would take between 8 to 12 months to replicate this solution 

The Generative AI models used by SM are OpenAI models that have been fine-tuned. They are served through Copilot and Copilot studio.

Multinational companies usually deploy one instance of Sustainability manager for the whole enterprise
