## 🔒 Executive Security Assessment

**Scope:** Domino SaaS Control Plane (AWS-hosted by vendor) connected to AstraZeneca-controlled private data planes (on-prem + AWS).  
**Objective:** Identify potential data privacy and security risks in the proposed architecture.

---

## ⚠️ 1. Potential Security Breaches & Concerns

### **1.1 Control Plane – Data Plane Trust Boundary**

- **Concern:** The control plane, operated by the vendor, holds orchestration authority and metadata visibility across AstraZeneca workloads.  
    → **Risk:** Compromise of the control plane (via supply-chain or insider threat) could enable _indirect control_ over AstraZeneca compute environments.  
    → **Impact:** Unauthorized scheduling or access to workload metadata; lateral movement risk if plane authentication tokens are misused.

### **1.2 Data Exfiltration via Domino File System (DFS)**

- **Concern:** File synchronization between data planes and control plane S3 buckets may transmit arbitrary user-generated files.  
    → **Risk:** PII/PHI or proprietary data unintentionally leaving the regulated boundary.  
    → **Impact:** Breach of data residency or regulatory frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, GxP).

### **1.3 Git Repository Integration**

- **Concern:** Control plane accesses Git repositories containing project code.  
    → **Risk:** Sensitive datasets or credentials accidentally committed could be pulled into the vendor environment.  
    → **Impact:** Leakage of internal IP or secret material; indirect credential exposure.
    

### **1.4 Model Monitoring Telemetry**

- **Concern:** Feature and prediction telemetry is transmitted to the SaaS control plane for drift detection.  
    → **Risk:** Even sanitized features may encode quasi-identifiers (e.g., hashed IDs, embeddings) enabling re-identification.  
    → **Impact:** Privacy breach, regulatory non-compliance, or exposure of derived business intelligence.
    

### **1.5 MLflow & Flyte Artifacts**

- **Concern:** Both systems log artifacts to control-plane S3 storage.  
    → **Risk:** User code could upload full datasets or model inputs/outputs; S3 misconfiguration could expose this externally.  
    → **Impact:** Data leakage to vendor or third parties; GxP/GDPR breach.
    

### **1.6 Execution Logs (stdout/stderr)**

- **Concern:** Logs containing sensitive payloads or stack traces are automatically collected and stored in vendor S3.  
    → **Risk:** Sensitive strings, identifiers, or query results leak via log ingestion.  
    → **Impact:** Low-visibility exfiltration path, difficult to monitor post-factum.
    

### **1.7 Supply-Chain / Update Cadence**

- **Concern:** Control plane receives weekly (or biannual GxP) updates managed solely by Domino.  
    → **Risk:** Code injection or compromised update pipeline could propagate to AstraZeneca data planes.  
    → **Impact:** Enterprise-wide compromise of compute orchestration via legitimate channel.
    

### **1.8 API & Identity Federation**

- **Concern:** Cross-plane authentication tokens or API credentials used between AstraZeneca and Domino endpoints.  
    → **Risk:** If these credentials are reused, cached, or inadequately scoped, attackers could pivot between clouds.  
    → **Impact:** Unauthorized command execution or job scheduling.
    

### **1.9 Lack of Native E2E Encryption Assurance**

- **Concern:** The document doesn’t explicitly state whether all inter-plane channels use **mutual TLS with cert rotation**, or if data-at-rest in control plane S3 is **client-side encrypted** with AstraZeneca-owned keys.  
    → **Risk:** Vendor-managed encryption could expose data to lawful access requests or insider compromise.  
    → **Impact:** Breach of confidentiality under shared responsibility model.
    

### **1.10 Telemetry and Metadata Aggregation**

- **Concern:** Vendor retains detailed metadata (project IDs, timestamps, user IDs, resource usage).  
    → **Risk:** Metadata correlation can leak operational patterns or model IP (“model-inference leakage”).  
    → **Impact:** Competitive intelligence or insider threat vector.

## 🧭 2. Recommendations

|#|Recommendation|Rationale|
|---|---|---|
|**1**|**Apply a strict “Metadata-Only” policy** — forbid any feature that uploads files, telemetry, or artifacts to the SaaS plane.|Eliminates egress paths (DFS, MLflow, Flyte, Monitoring).|
|**2**|**Deploy a dedicated “GxP-Hardened” SaaS tenant** with isolated VPC, private endpoint connectivity, and AstraZeneca-managed KMS keys for S3 encryption.|Reduces vendor visibility and strengthens key control.|
|**3**|**Mandate network isolation and scoped IAM roles** — no control plane network peering; enforce least privilege for inter-plane APIs.|Prevents lateral movement from control to data planes.|
|**4**|**Implement egress inspection and DLP** at the data plane boundary for outbound traffic to Domino endpoints.|Detects accidental sensitive data transfers.|
|**5**|**Integrate Domino control plane with AstraZeneca SSO via SAML/OIDC** and enforce MFA + just-in-time provisioning.|Strengthens identity governance and off-boarding control.|
|**6**|**Require mutual TLS (mTLS) and certificate rotation** for all control-plane/data-plane communication channels.|Mitigates MITM and impersonation risks.|
|**7**|**Institute pre-deployment security validation of Domino updates (especially GxP)** — including signed binaries and change logs.|Reduces supply-chain risk from vendor-managed upgrades.|
|**8**|**Disable default logging of stdout/stderr to vendor S3**, or apply automatic log redaction.|Prevents unintentional leakage of sensitive strings.|
|**9**|**Centralize audit trail ingestion** into AstraZeneca’s SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, etc.) via API integration.|Ensures enterprise visibility over vendor activity.|
|**10**|**Negotiate Data Processing Addendum (DPA) with right to audit** vendor’s SaaS environment, including sub-processor disclosure.|Strengthens contractual assurance and compliance oversight.|

## 🧩 3. Strategic Posture Recommendation

For highly regulated workloads (clinical, patient-linked, or IP-sensitive):

- Operate **Domino in “Private Control Plane Mode”** (fully AstraZeneca-managed) or **Domino Cloud for Life Sciences with all data-egress features disabled.**
    
- Treat the SaaS control plane strictly as an **orchestration and metadata manager** — not as a data store.
    
- Adopt a **zero-trust posture** across vendor boundaries: every API call, artifact, and telemetry channel must be authenticated, encrypted, and logged.

### ✅ Bottom Line

The proposed hybrid model is _architecturally sound_ for metadata-driven orchestration but **carries multiple latent egress and supply-chain risks**. With appropriate **feature hardening, encryption ownership, DLP, and identity governance**, it can meet AstraZeneca’s data privacy obligations — but **default SaaS configurations are insufficient for regulated data without modification.**
