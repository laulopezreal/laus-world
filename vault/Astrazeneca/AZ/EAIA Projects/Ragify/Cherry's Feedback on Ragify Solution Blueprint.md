# Cherry's Feedback on Ragify Solution Blueprint

**RAGIFY** review 
- Approving Ragify architecture including the MCP service would mean that enterprise architecture supports the library as a pattern, which we actually don't.
- It is okay for exploration.
- AI Architecture is exploring more enterprise scalable options for MCP and A2A (is an API and AWS Bedrock AgentCore)
- AWS bedrock is an enterprise platform (foundation models, agents, LLM gateway, etc)
- Mulesoft is an API Gateway, they have a new product named AgentForce with similar capabilities to agentcore and we are exploring it
