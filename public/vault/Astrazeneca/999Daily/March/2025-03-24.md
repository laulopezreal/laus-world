Domino blueprint update
Questions for Rakesh: 
1. Are there any automated processes that uses personal credentials? In such a case, they can now migrate to “service accounts” for better security and auditing.

2. Introduced in [Domino v5.10 are Domino Service Accounts](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/admin_guide/6921e5/domino-service-accounts/) as an alternative option to NPA API Keys for integrations. Admin role is required to manage this but it is a more secure and recommended way over non-personal accounts for service account integrations. Operational documentation will be created by the platform team to include a process for teams to request creation, review, modification, and revocation of these Service Accounts. -> Was this ever done?
3. 
4. New Governance Admin role. Was SysAdmin used for compliance tasks? clarify whether you will adopt the new role to reduce privilege overhead.
