## Ragify blueprint questions for AI platforms team:

1. I need the link to the official Jira and confluence pages/ GH Pages and GH Issues.
2. We need to agree on whether we want one vs. several blueprints (one for the python library, and a separate one for the Ragify services).
3. Need to clarify the following information
	1. How will the Solution be Serviced in BAU, and does the Service Design meet the requirements for a Minimal Viable Service? 
	2. Is this delivered as a service or as part of Platform delivery? 
	3. Has ‘Acceptance to Service’ been involved? Are there any changes to existing Services?  
	4. Names of teams who would be supporting the solution. Please clarify if multiple teams are involved and which solution components are supported by which team(s)._ (2.10)
4. Who is going to register the application in Service Now?
	1. This is required for section 3.2 of the blueprint:
5. Who is going to own the process of PIA and RID?
	1. PIA
		- According to this page we won't require to raise a PIA for Ragify: https://confluence.astrazeneca.com/display/AIS/Generative+AI+Process+Guidance
		- ![[Pasted image 20250627141509.png]]
		- Note the sentence: **"If your project will not involve any personal data processing you will not need to raise a PIA."**
	2. Risk Impact Determination (RID)
		1. **Important dependency**: To raise a RID it is important to have the application registered in SNOW.
		2. https://astrazeneca-eqv.veevavault.com/ui/#doc_info/1104855/12/0?state_type=steady_state__v&anQS=page3&annotate=false this is the SOP for RID
		3. This is the application portal: https://azcollaboration.sharepoint.com/sites/TSC241/Pages/HomePage.aspx
