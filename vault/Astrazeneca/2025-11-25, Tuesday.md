## Meeting R&D Compute Strategy and Domino

**Atendees**: Anders Advissor - Principal Architect - Strategy & Enterprise IT
We spoke about a check on the Domino and Sferical entries, AND a sanity check on the guiding questions to see if they are on the right level for the landscape guideance we have now.  

We also discussed I may need to split it the guide into one guide for Application/use and one guide for Compute

Then in the powerpoint deck we spoke about the Domino and Sferical entries on the Core Computing and AI Platforms in R&D at AZ slide.
For awareness this is a R&D compute strategy. Although I could see it be a base for expanding to a full AZ coverage.

**Action points:**
- Check on the Domino and Sferical entries of the slides
- Sanity check on the guiding questions to see if they are on the right level for the landscape guideance we have now
- Review the answers in the excel spreadsheet for Domino
