**Preparing examples for emails and reviews**

The user wants examples of emails and reviews with high scores, similar to the essay examples provided earlier. I need to prepare three examples for each task type, with each example being between 220-260 words. This is the standard length for C1 Advanced writing tasks. I'll make sure each of the emails and reviews showcases the highest possible quality to demonstrate what would earn top marks. I think I'll aim to keep things clear and concise but impactful.

**Planning email and review examples**

The user probably wants three examples for emails and three for reviews, to mirror the task format. Each example should follow the correct structure—emails should include salutation, introduction, body with bullet points, closing, and signature. Reviews should have a title, paragraph structure for strengths, weaknesses, and a conclusion with a rating. I'll keep word counts between 220-260 words to match the guidelines. Let’s create realistic, varied prompts for these: e.g., writing to complain about noise, requesting course details, or thanking someone for a job opportunity.

**Drafting email example**

I need to expand the initial email to fit within the required 220-260 word count range. The content should be relevant and detailed without losing formality or purpose. Here’s the plan: I'll start by adding an introductory paragraph about the writer's interest in the conference. Then, I’ll build out more detailed inquiries like payment methods, accommodations, and student discounts. After revising, I should have a refined email closer to 220-260 words that feels comprehensive yet polite, offering more professional context and explaining the significance of the event to the user's career.

Below are three high-scoring **Letter/Email** examples (≈230–250 words) followed by three **Review** examples (≈230–250 words), each carefully following the Part 2 templates.

## Letter / Email Examples

### Example 1 (Formal – Conference Enquiry)

```text
Dear Dr. Thompson,

I hope you are well. I recently completed my Master’s in Mechatronics at the University of Madrid and plan to attend the International Robotics Conference in Rome this July. As an aspiring robotics engineer focused on human–robot collaboration, I would be extremely grateful if you could provide further information regarding the event.

Specifically, I would appreciate your assistance with the following:
- Registration procedure and deadlines: Are there any early-bird rates, and what is the final date for sign-up?
- Payment options: Which methods are accepted and in which currencies? Is bank transfer available?
- Student concessions: Does the organising committee offer reduced fees or scholarships for recent graduates?
- Workshop opportunities: Could you share submission guidelines for presenting research?

Furthermore, attending sessions on AI-driven control systems would greatly inform my upcoming doctoral research. If you require any documentation, such as proof of student status or academic transcripts, I would be happy to provide them.

Thank you in advance for your time and support. I look forward to your response and to the chance to engage with leading experts in the field.

Yours sincerely,

Hi Alex,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m organising a student-led workshop on sustainable packaging next month and would love for you to join the planning team. Your expertise in materials science would be invaluable.

Could you:
- Brainstorm eco-friendly material options at our kick-off meeting on 12 May?
- Help draft a brief outline of hands-on activities for participants?
- Suggest potential guest speakers or industry contacts?

We’ll meet every Wednesday at 5 pm in Lab 3, but if another time suits you better, just let me know. Also, feel free to propose any creative ideas you have in mind.

Thanks a million for considering this—I know your input will make the workshop a success. Let me know if you need more details or have any questions.

Best regards,

### Example 3 (Semi-Formal – Office Facilities Complaint)

```text
Dear Ms. Carter,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express concerns regarding the heating system at our office on King Street. Over the past month, the radiators have intermittently failed, causing temperatures to drop below 16 °C and affecting staff comfort and productivity.

Could you please:
- Arrange for a full inspection and repair of the heating system as soon as possible.
- Provide an estimated timeline for completion.
- Advise whether any compensation or adjustments will be applied due to the disruption.
- Recommend any interim measures we can implement to maintain a safe working temperature.

To illustrate, on 11 and 14 April the heating switched off mid-morning, forcing staff to wear coats indoors and take unscheduled breaks. Given the precision required for our lab equipment, consistent climate control is essential.

We greatly value the working environment you provide and trust you will address this issue promptly. If you need further information or wish to visit the premises, please let me know.

Thank you for your swift attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,

John Ramírez  
Office Manager, GreenWave Innovations

## Review Examples

### Example 1: Restaurant Review

```text
**Title:** “A Culinary Journey at La Ruta”

**Introduction:**  
Having recently dined at **La Ruta**, I was captivated by both the inventive menu and warm atmosphere. In this review, I’ll outline the main strengths and a couple of minor drawbacks.

**Strengths:**  
1. **Ambience:** The rustic decor, soft lighting and gentle flamenco guitar created an intimate setting, perfect for both dates and small groups.  
2. **Service:** Staff were attentive without being intrusive. For instance, our server anticipated our water and bread refills before we asked.  
3. **Signature Dishes:** The saffron-infused paella was a standout—rice was perfectly al dente and seafood exceptionally fresh.

**Weaknesses:**  
1. **Pricing:** On the downside, main courses average €28–€32, which may deter budget-minded diners.  
2. **Dessert Selection:** While the crema catalana was delightful, the overall dessert menu felt limited; I would have welcomed a fruit-based option.

**Conclusion & Rating:**  
Overall, I would give **La Ruta** **4 ½ out of 5 stars**. I would highly recommend it to food enthusiasts seeking authentic yet creative Andalusian cuisine, provided they’re prepared for slightly higher prices.

### Example 2: Tech Product Review

```text
**Title:** “Why the BrightVision X5 Shines Bright”

**Introduction:**  
Having tested the **BrightVision X5** smartphone for two weeks, I was impressed by its sleek design and powerful performance. This review covers its primary benefits and a few caveats.

**Strengths:**  
1. **Display Quality:** The 6.7″ OLED screen delivers vivid colours and deep blacks. For example, HDR videos looked exceptionally crisp even in bright daylight.  
2. **Battery Life:** With moderate use, the X5 easily lasted a full day—and fast-charging achieved 60 % in just 25 minutes.  
3. **Camera Versatility:** Its 108 MP main lens and ultra-wide module captured stunning landscapes and sharp low-light portraits.

**Weaknesses:**  
1. **Price Point:** At €999, it undercuts some flagship rivals but remains a significant investment for budget-conscious buyers.  
2. **Software Bloat:** A handful of preinstalled apps, such as carrier-branded games, required manual removal and were difficult to uninstall completely.

**Conclusion & Rating:**  
Overall, I would give the **BrightVision X5** **4 out of 5 stars**. I would recommend it to tech-savvy users who prioritise camera performance and battery longevity, provided they can overlook the occasional software clutter.

### Example 3: Theatre Performance Review

```text
**Title:** “An Enchanting Night with ‘Midnight Sonata’”

**Introduction:**  
Having attended the premiere of **‘Midnight Sonata’** at the Apollo Theatre, I was struck by its ambitious staging and emotive score. In this review, I’ll examine its highs and a couple of areas for improvement.

**Strengths:**  
1. **Music & Sound Design:** The live orchestra brought Rachmaninoff’s themes to life, with seamless transitions and rich acoustics.  
2. **Set & Lighting:** Innovative rotating platforms and dynamic lighting shifts created dramatic contrasts, especially during the climactic third act.  
3. **Lead Performance:** Sofia Mendes delivered a powerful portrayal of the protagonist, her expressive vocals conveying deep emotional nuance.

**Weaknesses:**  
1. **Pacing:** On the downside, the second act felt overlong, with repetitive dialogue that slightly stalled the momentum.  
2. **Supporting Cast Balance:** A few ensemble members lacked vocal projection, making some choral passages sound uneven.

**Conclusion & Rating:**  
Overall, I would give **‘Midnight Sonata’** **4 out of 5 stars**. I would highly recommend it to classical-music aficionados and theatre-lovers seeking a visually stunning, musically rich experience, bearing in mind the minor pacing issues.
