- **Purpose of this Tech radar is  highlighting **current mainstream technologies**, **near-future trends**, and **experimental innovations**. We’ll start with general AI trends and then delve into **real examples in pharma/life sciences**, bridging technical capabilities with industry use-cases.
    
- **Approach:** Cover “both worlds” – the broad AI landscape and domain-specific impacts. Trends are grouped by time horizon (now, next, future) to inform strategic planning and adoption roadmaps.
    

## Slide 2: Key Current AI Trends (2024-2025)

- **Generative AI & Foundation Models:** Explosion of large AI models for text, image, and code generation (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.). _GenAI_ went mainstream in 2023 – e.g. ChatGPT reached **100 million users in 2 months** (fastest consumer app ever reaching these numbers)[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/#:~:text=Feb%201%20%28Reuters%29%20,a%20UBS%20study%20on%20Wednesday). Enterprises are racing to leverage this tech; by 2026, Gartner predicts **70% of new application development** will be influenced by generative AI[gartner.com](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2024#:~:text=)
    
- **AI Engineering (MLOps) at Scale:** Focus on operationalizing AI in production. Organizations are investing in **DataOps/MLOps pipelines** to deploy AI reliably and at scale. 
Gartner’s AI Hype Cycle highlights _AI engineering_ as critical for unifying data and model pipelines (from cloud to edge) which is the way to reach **coherent, enterprise-wide AI delivery**[seldon.io](https://www.seldon.io/the-significance-of-ai-engineering-in-the-gartner-hype-cycle/#:~:text=AI%20Engineering%20in%20the%20Hype,Cycle). 
In practice, this means building robust model **deployment, monitoring, and lifecycle management** to move from experimental pilots to stable AI services.
    
- **Responsible & Trustworthy AI:** Ensuring AI systems are **ethical, transparent, and secure** is a top priority (especially in regulated industries). Frameworks like **AI TRiSM** (Trust, Risk & Security Management) have emerged to govern AI models’ fairness, reliability, and compliance[splunk.com](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/ai-trism-ai-trust-risk-security-management.html#:~:text=,such%20as). Organizations are implementing bias mitigation, explainability, and rigorous validation to build user trust and meet new AI regulations. (For example, the upcoming EU AI Act demands risk controls on AI applications.)
    
- **Edge AI and IoT Integration:** Increasing deployment of AI **closer to data sources** on devices and “smart” sensors. This enables real-time insights with low latency – e.g. **AI on wearables and medical IoT** for health monitoring. Edge AI runs on smartphones, smartwatches, even lab equipment, processing data locally without constant cloud connectivity[ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/edge-vs-cloud-ai#:~:text=Edge%20AI%20refers%20to%20the,applications%20closer%20to%20data%20sources)[ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/edge-vs-cloud-ai#:~:text=Edge%20AI%20uses%20certain%20kinds,in%20the%20devices%20it%20powers). This trend reduces bandwidth costs and improves privacy, and is used in settings like manufacturing lines and remote patient monitoring (where instant analytics are critical).
    

## Slide 3: AI in Pharma & Life Sciences – Real Use Cases

_AI in the lab: a scientist uses a microscope alongside an AI-driven robotic assistant (illustrative)._  
AI is already delivering tangible results in life sciences, transforming how new therapies are discovered, tested, and delivered. Traditionally conservative, pharma is now embracing AI to **accelerate R&D** and improve outcomes, with multiple real-world successes:

- **AI-Accelerated Drug Discovery & Design:** Pharmaceutical R&D is being sped up by AI-driven platforms. For example, UK startup _Exscientia_ used AI (its “Centaur Chemist” platform) to design a novel cancer drug that reached clinical trials in under **12 months**[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=Rise%20of%20AI,Platforms) – dramatically faster than traditional timelines. Large pharma are also leveraging AI partnerships; _Pfizer_ teamed with AI companies (Tempus, CytoReason, Gero) to streamline drug discovery and even helped accelerate development of the COVID-19 antiviral **Paxlovid** using AI insights[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=Pfizer). These cases show AI reducing the cost and time of drug design by automating molecule generation and target identification.
    
- **Generative AI in R&D (Biology):** Advances like _DeepMind’s AlphaFold_ have revolutionized biology by predicting protein structures with high accuracy. AlphaFold solved >200 million protein structures and is used by over **1.2 million researchers** worldwide to tackle diseases (malaria, cancer, etc.)[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=opening%20doors%20to%20faster%2C%20more,accurate%20solutions). This generative AI for proteins accelerates target discovery and vaccine design. Looking ahead, new AI models can even **design entirely new proteins** not seen in nature (e.g. DeepMind’s “Genie” model)[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=But%20it%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20stop%20there,diseases%20like%20Alzheimer%E2%80%99s%20and%20cancer), opening the door to bespoke therapeutics.
    
- **Smarter Clinical Trials:** AI is optimizing clinical development by making trials faster and more efficient. One major hurdle – patient recruitment – is being tackled with AI algorithms that scan medical records to match patients to trials **in days instead of months**[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20major%20win,a%20broader%20range%20of%20participants). For instance, an AI tool (_TrialGPT_) can automatically find eligible participants from health data[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=Recruiting%20the%20right%20patients%20has,recruitment%20but%20also%20helps%20ensure), helping to fill trials quicker (important since ~25% of studies fail due to under-enrollment[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20major%20win,a%20broader%20range%20of%20participants)). AI is also used to adapt trial design on the fly (analyzing interim results) and even simulate control arms with “digital twins” of patient data, which in one Alzheimer’s study **cut required participants by 21%**[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=And%20here%E2%80%99s%20where%20things%20get,making%20it%20faster%20to%20bring). These innovations lead to faster approvals and cost savings.
    
- **AI in Diagnostics & Personalized Care:** In healthcare delivery, AI-driven diagnostics are improving accuracy and speed. For example, AI vision models can analyze radiology images to **detect tumors or abnormalities** that doctors might miss[infosys.com](https://www.infosys.com/iki/research/ai-business-value-radar2025-life-sciences.html#:~:text=to%20Phase%20III%20drug%20trials,and%20in%20regulatory%20review). Pharma companies like AstraZeneca are using AI (e.g. with partner Qure.ai) to interpret chest scans and identify diseases (such as lung fibrosis or kidney disease) earlier[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=AstraZeneca). Additionally, AI voice analysis and genomics AI are being explored for predictive diagnostics. This push towards precision medicine means treatments can be tailored to patients based on AI insights (e.g. predicting who will respond to a drug).
    
- **Operational Efficiency & Automation:** Beyond R&D, pharma companies are applying AI to manufacturing and supply chain operations. A great example is _Pfizer’s use of intelligent automation_ in its temperature-controlled supply chain – AI systems monitor and adjust conditions in real time, reducing human error and ensuring quality in vaccine distribution[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=to%20a%20highly%20efficient%2C%20AI,system). Predictive maintenance AI models foresee equipment failures in factories to prevent downtime. Some firms are implementing **digital twins** of production lines to simulate and optimize processes before making physical changes[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=And%20here%E2%80%99s%20where%20things%20get,making%20it%20faster%20to%20bring). The result is higher efficiency, lower costs, and more reliable delivery of medicines.
    

## Slide 4: Emerging & Future AI Technologies

- **Autonomous AI Agents (“Agentic AI”):** The next frontier is AI systems that can **act autonomously** to perform tasks or make decisions in collaboration with other AI agents. Rather than single-response chatbots, these are goal-driven _AI agents_ that carry out multi-step operations (e.g. automatically research a topic, then draft a report, then refine based on feedback). Hype around prototypes like AutoGPT emerged in 2024. Enterprises are intrigued – over **25% of organizations are already exploring agentic AI** on a significant scale[deloitte.com](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/what-we-do/capabilities/applied-artificial-intelligence/content/state-of-generative-ai-in-enterprise.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L659%20relate%20to,while%20remembering%20what%20they%E2%80%99ve%20done). The vision is that such agents could reliably handle complex workflows by processing multi-modal data and coordinating with other agents (while remembering past actions)[deloitte.com](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/what-we-do/capabilities/applied-artificial-intelligence/content/state-of-generative-ai-in-enterprise.html#:~:text=relate%20to%20agentic%20AI,while%20remembering%20what%20they%E2%80%99ve%20done). This is still early-stage, but pilot use-cases (like AI assistants for IT support, or autonomous research agents in labs) are under experimentation.
    
- **Federated Learning & Privacy-Preserving AI:** As data privacy regulations grow, new techniques allow AI models to train on **distributed data** without aggregating it in one place. _Federated learning (FL)_ is an emerging approach where an algorithm learns from data kept locally at hospitals or institutions, sending only model updates (not raw patient data). This enables collaborative analytics across silos while protecting sensitive information[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01836-3?error=cookies_not_supported&code=fa8479d7-ef09-4535-a2b5-c4216e3101bf#:~:text=governance%20and%20ethical%20challenges4%20,the%20data%2034%2C6%20%2C%2036). In healthcare, FL is already used for things like predicting hospitalizations or improving cancer detection by learning from multiple hospitals’ data **without sharing patient records**[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01836-3?error=cookies_not_supported&code=fa8479d7-ef09-4535-a2b5-c4216e3101bf#:~:text=who%20continues%20this%20process%20with,other%20data%20owners9). Expect wider adoption of FL and related privacy-enhancing technologies (secure multi-party compute, homomorphic encryption) so that AI can comply with strict data protection laws while still gaining insights from large-scale data.
    
- **AI-Designed Molecules & Proteins (Generative Biology):** Today’s generative AI is not just about text and images – it’s beginning to generate _biology_. We discussed AlphaFold’s impact; the next step is AI that proposes new drug molecules or protein therapies from scratch. Early success stories (Exscientia, Insilico Medicine) hint at the potential: Insilico’s AI-designed drug for pulmonary fibrosis entered human trials in just 2.5 years[insilico.com](https://insilico.com/phase1#:~:text=From%20Start%20to%20Phase%201,of%20February%2C%202022%2C%20Insilico). Researchers are now using generative models to invent proteins with desired functions (enzymes, antibodies) in a fraction of the time of lab experiments. For example, the _Genie_ model can **design novel proteins** that meet specific goals (e.g. binding to a virus)[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=But%20it%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20stop%20there,diseases%20like%20Alzheimer%E2%80%99s%20and%20cancer). This experimental area could radically speed up vaccine and drug development – envision AI proposing a cure for a disease by virtually screening and “inventing” the biological agent. It’s early days, but progress here is accelerating.
    
- **Quantum Computing for AI (Future Outlook):** Looking a bit farther out, quantum computing promises to **turbocharge AI capabilities**. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is still mostly in research labs, but it could enable breakthroughs especially in drug discovery and precision medicine. Quantum computers can theoretically analyze complex molecular interactions or huge data states exponentially faster. A recent review suggests quantum methods have the potential to deliver _faster, more accurate diagnostics and personalized treatments_ by handling computation beyond classical limits[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18639#:~:text=,However%2C%20integrating%20quantum%20technologies). For instance, quantum-generated models might explore chemical space more efficiently to find new drug candidates[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-024-02526-3#:~:text=,KRAS%20inhibitors%20for%20cancer%20therapy). Major tech firms and pharma companies (IBM, Google, Roche, etc.) are investing in QML experiments. While practical quantum AI applications may be a few years away, this is a key “watching brief” on the radar – a future **game-changer** if technical challenges (qubit stability, error correction) are overcome.
    

## Slide 5: Conclusion & Next Steps

- **AI as a Strategic Imperative:** The rapid developments in AI – from today’s generative AI to tomorrow’s autonomous agents – mean that AI is now central to business innovation. The enterprise architects’ role is to ensure the organization can **leverage these technologies** effectively. This includes aligning AI initiatives with business goals (e.g. faster drug launches, better customer engagement) and keeping an eye on emerging tech that could provide a competitive edge. Not every hyped innovation will pan out, but ignoring AI trends is not an option.
    
- **Adopt, Trial, Assess:** Treat this tech radar as guidance for action. **Current “Adopt” items** (like generative AI and robust MLOps practices) should be integrated into your IT roadmaps now – e.g. deploying an internal LLM for knowledge management, or automating model deployment pipelines. **Near-future “Trial” items** (like federated learning or agentic AI) warrant experimentation through pilots or proofs-of-concept in the next 12-18 months, so your organization builds competence early. **Future “Assess” items** (quantum AI, etc.) should be monitored and studied via R&D partnerships or innovation teams, until they mature enough for investment.
    
- **Enablement and Governance:** To succeed with AI at scale, enterprises must invest in the **foundations** – data quality, infrastructure, and people. High-performing companies in life sciences pair heavy AI investment with digital transformation and training[infosys.com](https://www.infosys.com/iki/research/ai-business-value-radar2025-life-sciences.html#:~:text=,in%20terms%20of%20success%20rate). Upskilling your workforce (data scientists, domain experts) and fostering an AI-ready culture is crucial[infosys.com](https://www.infosys.com/iki/research/ai-business-value-radar2025-life-sciences.html#:~:text=,lead%20to%20even%20stronger%20results). Equally important is strengthening AI governance: put in place the policies (as in AI TRiSM) to ensure models are audited for bias, data is managed ethically, and regulatory compliance is maintained. By preparing now – improving data pipelines, addressing change management, and instituting responsible AI frameworks – enterprise architects can help unlock AI’s full business value while mitigating risks. **In summary**, stay pragmatic but forward-looking: capitalize on what AI can do today, and architect the organization to be ready for what’s coming next.
