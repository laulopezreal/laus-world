Although I could see it be a base for expanding to a full AZ coverage.\n\n**Action points:**\n- Check on the Domino and Sferical entries of the slides\n- Sanity check on the guiding questions to see if they are on the right level for the landscape guideance we have now\n- Review the answers in the excel spreadsheet for Domino",

      "content": "From an architecture perspective, using an AWS Route53 Resolver rule to forward DNS resolution for Azure private endpoints to the corresponding Azure DNS servers, and associating it with the relevant VPC, is a valid and established cross-cloud pattern. This is appropriate where AWS workloads need to resolve Azure services exposed via private endpoints.\n\nA few important conditions to note:\n\nThis applies only to workloads running inside a VPC associated with the resolver rule; it will not address components outside that scope.\n\nThe rule should be domain-specific and tightly scoped.\n\nStandard change and approval processes (including AWS Account Owner approval) should be followed.\n\nThe dependency on cross-cloud private DNS resolution should be documented (e.g. Architecture Note or ADR).\n\nProvided these conditions are met, I don’t see architectural concerns with proceeding using this approach.\n\nThanks,\nLaura",

      "content": "## 1️⃣ Opening & Self-Introduction\n\n- **Who you are**  \n    “I’m Laura López-Real, Enterprise AI Architect at AstraZeneca, responsible for the strategy and tooling that enable our mainframe and legacy modernization. I oversee architecture, compliance and tool selection for cloud-ready services.”\n    \n- **Reason for meeting**  \n    “We’re in early discovery on replatforming COBOL and PL/I workloads. I’m evaluating automated documentation and business-rule extraction to shorten analysis cycles and reduce dependency on scarce legacy expertise.”\n    \n\n---\n\n## 2️⃣ What to Highlight from Your Context\n\n- **Key initiative**: _Invest in Agentic-AI-centric tools that produce efficiency gains at the business level_  \n    – Link this to Swimm’s AI-generated documentation and reverse engineering.\n    \n- **Timeline**: Target shortlist within **6–9 months**; modernization target completion **~2026**.\n    \n- **Pain points**:\n    \n    - Incomplete or outdated code documentation.\n        \n    - High risk of knowledge loss as experts retire.\n        \n    - Need for traceable compliance and auditable code mapping.\n        \n\n---\n\n## 3️⃣ Deeper Questions to Ask Swimm\n\nUse these to get detailed, decision-ready insights:\n\n**Technology & Capabilities**\n\n- How does Swimm perform business-rule extraction on COBOL and PL/I?\n    \n- Can it automatically detect inter-module dependencies and data lineage for large, heterogeneous codebases?\n    \n- How accurate is the generated documentation vs. manual SME review? Any benchmarks?\n    \n\n**Integration & Workflow**\n\n- How does Swimm integrate with existing tools (e.g., Git, Jira, ServiceNow) and CI/CD?\n    \n- Can it feed outputs into cloud-migration accelerators (e.g., AWS Mainframe Modernization, Azure Migrate)?\n    \n\n**Security & Compliance**\n\n- How is sensitive business logic handled (on-prem vs. cloud deployment)?\n    \n- Can Swimm enforce versioning, audit trails and GDPR/PCI/NIS2/DORA requirements?\n    \n\n**Scalability & Performance**\n\n- What is the largest codebase successfully documented (lines of code, number of modules)?\n    \n- Typical processing time and infrastructure requirements?\n    \n\n**Cost & ROI**\n\n- Pricing model (per KLOC, per repository, or enterprise license)?\n    \n- Example ROI from comparable pharmaceutical or regulated enterprises.\n    \n\n**Support & Change Management**\n\n- What onboarding/training is required for dev and architecture teams?\n    \n- Does Swimm assist in upskilling staff or providing SMEs for complex rule extraction?\n    \n\n---\n\n## 4️⃣ Points to Emphasize in Discussion\n\n- Swimm aligns with your **agentic-AI efficiency** initiative—automation that replaces months of manual discovery.\n    \n- Stress need for **audit-ready, explainable outputs** to satisfy internal and external compliance.\n    \n- Highlight **multi-language complexity** (COBOL, PL/I, Java) and **global operations** as key selection criteria.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 5️⃣ Close the Meeting Strong\n\n- Summarize fit: “Swimm’s AI-based documentation seems aligned with our goals of accelerating replatforming and reducing dependency on scarce legacy expertise.”\n    \n- Next step: request a **technical deep dive or pilot** aligned with your 6–9 month evaluation window.\n    \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to draft a **one-minute self-introduction script** that weaves these points into a natural opener you can read or memorize?",

      "content": "## Slide 1: Introduction & Context\n\n- The ideal audience for this presentation AZ colleagues from IT looking to align technology strategy with the latest AI trends.\n    \n- **Purpose of this Tech radar is  highlighting **current mainstream technologies**, **near-future trends**, and **experimental innovations**. We’ll start with general AI trends and then delve into **real examples in pharma/life sciences**, bridging technical capabilities with industry use-cases.\n    \n- **Approach:** Cover “both worlds” – the broad AI landscape and domain-specific impacts. Trends are grouped by time horizon (now, next, future) to inform strategic planning and adoption roadmaps.\n    \n\n## Slide 2: Key Current AI Trends (2024-2025)\n\n- **Generative AI & Foundation Models:** Explosion of large AI models for text, image, and code generation (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.). _GenAI_ went mainstream in 2023 – e.g. ChatGPT reached **100 million users in 2 months** (fastest consumer app ever reaching these numbers)[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/#:~:text=Feb%201%20%28Reuters%29%20,a%20UBS%20study%20on%20Wednesday). Enterprises are racing to leverage this tech; by 2026, Gartner predicts **70% of new application development** will be influenced by generative AI[gartner.com](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2024#:~:text=)\n    \n- **AI Engineering (MLOps) at Scale:** Focus on operationalizing AI in production. Organizations are investing in **DataOps/MLOps pipelines** to deploy AI reliably and at scale. \nGartner’s AI Hype Cycle highlights _AI engineering_ as critical for unifying data and model pipelines (from cloud to edge) which is the way to reach **coherent, enterprise-wide AI delivery**[seldon.io](https://www.seldon.io/the-significance-of-ai-engineering-in-the-gartner-hype-cycle/#:~:text=AI%20Engineering%20in%20the%20Hype,Cycle). \nIn practice, this means building robust model **deployment, monitoring, and lifecycle management** to move from experimental pilots to stable AI services.\n    \n- **Responsible & Trustworthy AI:** Ensuring AI systems are **ethical, transparent, and secure** is a top priority (especially in regulated industries). Frameworks like **AI TRiSM** (Trust, Risk & Security Management) have emerged to govern AI models’ fairness, reliability, and compliance[splunk.com](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/ai-trism-ai-trust-risk-security-management.html#:~:text=,such%20as). Organizations are implementing bias mitigation, explainability, and rigorous validation to build user trust and meet new AI regulations. (For example, the upcoming EU AI Act demands risk controls on AI applications.)\n    \n- **Edge AI and IoT Integration:** Increasing deployment of AI **closer to data sources** on devices and “smart” sensors. This enables real-time insights with low latency – e.g. **AI on wearables and medical IoT** for health monitoring. Edge AI runs on smartphones, smartwatches, even lab equipment, processing data locally without constant cloud connectivity[ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/edge-vs-cloud-ai#:~:text=Edge%20AI%20refers%20to%20the,applications%20closer%20to%20data%20sources)[ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/edge-vs-cloud-ai#:~:text=Edge%20AI%20uses%20certain%20kinds,in%20the%20devices%20it%20powers). This trend reduces bandwidth costs and improves privacy, and is used in settings like manufacturing lines and remote patient monitoring (where instant analytics are critical).\n    \n\n## Slide 3: AI in Pharma & Life Sciences – Real Use Cases\n\n_AI in the lab: a scientist uses a microscope alongside an AI-driven robotic assistant (illustrative)._  \nAI is already delivering tangible results in life sciences, transforming how new therapies are discovered, tested, and delivered. Traditionally conservative, pharma is now embracing AI to **accelerate R&D** and improve outcomes, with multiple real-world successes:\n\n- **AI-Accelerated Drug Discovery & Design:** Pharmaceutical R&D is being sped up by AI-driven platforms. For example, UK startup _Exscientia_ used AI (its “Centaur Chemist” platform) to design a novel cancer drug that reached clinical trials in under **12 months**[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=Rise%20of%20AI,Platforms) – dramatically faster than traditional timelines. Large pharma are also leveraging AI partnerships; _Pfizer_ teamed with AI companies (Tempus, CytoReason, Gero) to streamline drug discovery and even helped accelerate development of the COVID-19 antiviral **Paxlovid** using AI insights[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=Pfizer). These cases show AI reducing the cost and time of drug design by automating molecule generation and target identification.\n    \n- **Generative AI in R&D (Biology):** Advances like _DeepMind’s AlphaFold_ have revolutionized biology by predicting protein structures with high accuracy. AlphaFold solved >200 million protein structures and is used by over **1.2 million researchers** worldwide to tackle diseases (malaria, cancer, etc.)[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=opening%20doors%20to%20faster%2C%20more,accurate%20solutions). This generative AI for proteins accelerates target discovery and vaccine design. Looking ahead, new AI models can even **design entirely new proteins** not seen in nature (e.g. DeepMind’s “Genie” model)[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=But%20it%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20stop%20there,diseases%20like%20Alzheimer%E2%80%99s%20and%20cancer), opening the door to bespoke therapeutics.\n    \n- **Smarter Clinical Trials:** AI is optimizing clinical development by making trials faster and more efficient. One major hurdle – patient recruitment – is being tackled with AI algorithms that scan medical records to match patients to trials **in days instead of months**[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20major%20win,a%20broader%20range%20of%20participants). For instance, an AI tool (_TrialGPT_) can automatically find eligible participants from health data[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=Recruiting%20the%20right%20patients%20has,recruitment%20but%20also%20helps%20ensure), helping to fill trials quicker (important since ~25% of studies fail due to under-enrollment[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20major%20win,a%20broader%20range%20of%20participants)). AI is also used to adapt trial design on the fly (analyzing interim results) and even simulate control arms with “digital twins” of patient data, which in one Alzheimer’s study **cut required participants by 21%**[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=And%20here%E2%80%99s%20where%20things%20get,making%20it%20faster%20to%20bring). These innovations lead to faster approvals and cost savings.\n    \n- **AI in Diagnostics & Personalized Care:** In healthcare delivery, AI-driven diagnostics are improving accuracy and speed. For example, AI vision models can analyze radiology images to **detect tumors or abnormalities** that doctors might miss[infosys.com](https://www.infosys.com/iki/research/ai-business-value-radar2025-life-sciences.html#:~:text=to%20Phase%20III%20drug%20trials,and%20in%20regulatory%20review). Pharma companies like AstraZeneca are using AI (e.g. with partner Qure.ai) to interpret chest scans and identify diseases (such as lung fibrosis or kidney disease) earlier[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=AstraZeneca). Additionally, AI voice analysis and genomics AI are being explored for predictive diagnostics. This push towards precision medicine means treatments can be tailored to patients based on AI insights (e.g. predicting who will respond to a drug).\n    \n- **Operational Efficiency & Automation:** Beyond R&D, pharma companies are applying AI to manufacturing and supply chain operations. A great example is _Pfizer’s use of intelligent automation_ in its temperature-controlled supply chain – AI systems monitor and adjust conditions in real time, reducing human error and ensuring quality in vaccine distribution[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=to%20a%20highly%20efficient%2C%20AI,system). Predictive maintenance AI models foresee equipment failures in factories to prevent downtime. Some firms are implementing **digital twins** of production lines to simulate and optimize processes before making physical changes[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=And%20here%E2%80%99s%20where%20things%20get,making%20it%20faster%20to%20bring). The result is higher efficiency, lower costs, and more reliable delivery of medicines.\n    \n\n## Slide 4: Emerging & Future AI Technologies\n\n- **Autonomous AI Agents (“Agentic AI”):** The next frontier is AI systems that can **act autonomously** to perform tasks or make decisions in collaboration with other AI agents. Rather than single-response chatbots, these are goal-driven _AI agents_ that carry out multi-step operations (e.g. automatically research a topic, then draft a report, then refine based on feedback). Hype around prototypes like AutoGPT emerged in 2024. Enterprises are intrigued – over **25% of organizations are already exploring agentic AI** on a significant scale[deloitte.com](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/what-we-do/capabilities/applied-artificial-intelligence/content/state-of-generative-ai-in-enterprise.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L659%20relate%20to,while%20remembering%20what%20they%E2%80%99ve%20done). The vision is that such agents could reliably handle complex workflows by processing multi-modal data and coordinating with other agents (while remembering past actions)[deloitte.com](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/what-we-do/capabilities/applied-artificial-intelligence/content/state-of-generative-ai-in-enterprise.html#:~:text=relate%20to%20agentic%20AI,while%20remembering%20what%20they%E2%80%99ve%20done). This is still early-stage, but pilot use-cases (like AI assistants for IT support, or autonomous research agents in labs) are under experimentation.\n    \n- **Federated Learning & Privacy-Preserving AI:** As data privacy regulations grow, new techniques allow AI models to train on **distributed data** without aggregating it in one place. _Federated learning (FL)_ is an emerging approach where an algorithm learns from data kept locally at hospitals or institutions, sending only model updates (not raw patient data). This enables collaborative analytics across silos while protecting sensitive information[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01836-3?error=cookies_not_supported&code=fa8479d7-ef09-4535-a2b5-c4216e3101bf#:~:text=governance%20and%20ethical%20challenges4%20,the%20data%2034%2C6%20%2C%2036). In healthcare, FL is already used for things like predicting hospitalizations or improving cancer detection by learning from multiple hospitals’ data **without sharing patient records**[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01836-3?error=cookies_not_supported&code=fa8479d7-ef09-4535-a2b5-c4216e3101bf#:~:text=who%20continues%20this%20process%20with,other%20data%20owners9). Expect wider adoption of FL and related privacy-enhancing technologies (secure multi-party compute, homomorphic encryption) so that AI can comply with strict data protection laws while still gaining insights from large-scale data.\n    \n- **AI-Designed Molecules & Proteins (Generative Biology):** Today’s generative AI is not just about text and images – it’s beginning to generate _biology_. We discussed AlphaFold’s impact; the next step is AI that proposes new drug molecules or protein therapies from scratch. Early success stories (Exscientia, Insilico Medicine) hint at the potential: Insilico’s AI-designed drug for pulmonary fibrosis entered human trials in just 2.5 years[insilico.com](https://insilico.com/phase1#:~:text=From%20Start%20to%20Phase%201,of%20February%2C%202022%2C%20Insilico). Researchers are now using generative models to invent proteins with desired functions (enzymes, antibodies) in a fraction of the time of lab experiments. For example, the _Genie_ model can **design novel proteins** that meet specific goals (e.g. binding to a virus)[coherentsolutions.com](https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations#:~:text=But%20it%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20stop%20there,diseases%20like%20Alzheimer%E2%80%99s%20and%20cancer). This experimental area could radically speed up vaccine and drug development – envision AI proposing a cure for a disease by virtually screening and “inventing” the biological agent. It’s early days, but progress here is accelerating.\n    \n- **Quantum Computing for AI (Future Outlook):** Looking a bit farther out, quantum computing promises to **turbocharge AI capabilities**. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is still mostly in research labs, but it could enable breakthroughs especially in drug discovery and precision medicine. Quantum computers can theoretically analyze complex molecular interactions or huge data states exponentially faster. A recent review suggests quantum methods have the potential to deliver _faster, more accurate diagnostics and personalized treatments_ by handling computation beyond classical limits[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18639#:~:text=,However%2C%20integrating%20quantum%20technologies). For instance, quantum-generated models might explore chemical space more efficiently to find new drug candidates[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-024-02526-3#:~:text=,KRAS%20inhibitors%20for%20cancer%20therapy). Major tech firms and pharma companies (IBM, Google, Roche, etc.) are investing in QML experiments. While practical quantum AI applications may be a few years away, this is a key “watching brief” on the radar – a future **game-changer** if technical challenges (qubit stability, error correction) are overcome.\n    \n\n## Slide 5: Conclusion & Next Steps\n\n- **AI as a Strategic Imperative:** The rapid developments in AI – from today’s generative AI to tomorrow’s autonomous agents – mean that AI is now central to business innovation. The enterprise architects’ role is to ensure the organization can **leverage these technologies** effectively. This includes aligning AI initiatives with business goals (e.g. faster drug launches, better customer engagement) and keeping an eye on emerging tech that could provide a competitive edge. Not every hyped innovation will pan out, but ignoring AI trends is not an option.\n    \n- **Adopt, Trial, Assess:** Treat this tech radar as guidance for action. **Current “Adopt” items** (like generative AI and robust MLOps practices) should be integrated into your IT roadmaps now – e.g. deploying an internal LLM for knowledge management, or automating model deployment pipelines. **Near-future “Trial” items** (like federated learning or agentic AI) warrant experimentation through pilots or proofs-of-concept in the next 12-18 months, so your organization builds competence early. **Future “Assess” items** (quantum AI, etc.) should be monitored and studied via R&D partnerships or innovation teams, until they mature enough for investment.\n    \n- **Enablement and Governance:** To succeed with AI at scale, enterprises must invest in the **foundations** – data quality, infrastructure, and people. High-performing companies in life sciences pair heavy AI investment with digital transformation and training[infosys.com](https://www.infosys.com/iki/research/ai-business-value-radar2025-life-sciences.html#:~:text=,in%20terms%20of%20success%20rate). Upskilling your workforce (data scientists, domain experts) and fostering an AI-ready culture is crucial[infosys.com](https://www.infosys.com/iki/research/ai-business-value-radar2025-life-sciences.html#:~:text=,lead%20to%20even%20stronger%20results). Equally important is strengthening AI governance: put in place the policies (as in AI TRiSM) to ensure models are audited for bias, data is managed ethically, and regulatory compliance is maintained. By preparing now – improving data pipelines, addressing change management, and instituting responsible AI frameworks – enterprise architects can help unlock AI’s full business value while mitigating risks. **In summary**, stay pragmatic but forward-looking: capitalize on what AI can do today, and architect the organization to be ready for what’s coming next.

Run the Python layout script and check output\n    \n2. Load `graph_deckgl.json` in the React Deck.gl component\n    \n3. Experiment with `ForceAtlas2`, `Fruchterman-Reingold`, or `YifanHu` layouts for better maps\n    \n4. Optional: Normalize coordinates for zoom/pan compatibility\n    \n\nWould you like me to generate the layout now with the `papers2.json` you provided?\n\n##### You said:\n\nokay that's one but I also want a script that uses the already existing coordenates\n\n###### ChatGPT said:\n\nIt looks like the dataset doesn't contain consistent `x` and `y` coordinate fields under the common keys (`x`, `y`, or `props.layout.x`). To proceed, I’ll inspect a few sample nodes from the tree structure to determine where (if anywhere) the coordinates might be stored.\n\nLet me fetch a few example nodes now.\n\nSample Tree Nodes\n\n|typeNumber|id|paperNode|topicNode|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|247|False|True|\n|1|248|False|True|\n|1|249|False|True|\n\nThe dataset does **not** contain precomputed `x` and `y` coordinates for the nodes — at least not in the main fields or inside `props`.\n\nInstead, you'll need to **compute the layout yourself** using a layout algorithm like ForceAtlas2, then export the resulting `{ id, x, y }` for Deck.gl.\n\nWould you like me to:\n\n1. Generate a Python script that computes coordinates using **ForceAtlas2 via NetworkX + fa2** and writes the output as JSON?\n    \n2. Show how to plug that into a **React + Deck.gl scatterplot layer**?\n    \n\nLet’s proceed with step 1 if that’s OK with you.\n\n##### You said:\n\nso how does it work in the current UI?\n\n###### ChatGPT said:\n\nGreat question — let's break down how the current Ontoverse UI (based on the `HierarchyGraph.ts` and `GraphGridLayout.ts`) **computes and assigns coordinates to the nodes**:\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Current Coordinate Assignment Strategy (in Ontoverse UI)\n\nThe UI uses **D3’s `pack()` layout algorithm** to compute node positions. Here's how it works:\n\n#### 1. **D3 Hierarchy Construction**\n\nts\n\nCopyEdit\n\n`const rootNode = hierarchy(graphData.treeNode);`\n\nThis builds a D3 `HierarchyNode` tree from the nested topic → subtopic → paper structure.\n\n#### 2. **Node Value Assignment**\n\nEach node is assigned a `.value` used to influence its relative size in the layout:\n\nts\n\nCopyEdit\n\n`rootNode.sum((d) => (d as { value: number }).value * 10);`\n\nThis \"weight\" affects the final radius (`r`) of each node.\n\n#### 3. **D3 Pack Layout: Assigning x/y/r**\n\nts\n\nCopyEdit\n\n`pack<TreeNode>().size([3840, 2160])(rootNode);`\n\nThis assigns `x`, `y`, and `r` to every node based on a **circle packing algorithm**, trying to prevent overlap.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Implications\n\n- The layout is deterministic and based on hierarchical containment (i.e. \"packed bubbles\").\n    \n- The center of each topic contains its children (like subtopics or papers).\n    \n- The node coordinates are stored in each node as `.x` and `.y`.\n    \n\n---\n\n### 🧩 Where Deck.gl Comes In\n\nTo replicate this layout in Deck.gl, you would:\n\n- Extract `{ id, x, y, r, title, ... }` from the `HierarchyNode[]` after the D3 pack layout.\n    \n- Feed it into a `ScatterplotLayer` or `TextLayer`.\n    \n\n---\n\n### ✅ What You Asked Before\n\nYou asked for two options:\n\n1. **Use layout algorithms (like ForceAtlas2)** → to simulate natural clustering.\n    \n2. **Use already existing coordinates** → from the current D3 `pack()` layout.\n    \n\nYou can do both:\n\n- Compute and export the D3-assigned `{ id, x, y, r }` layout as a JSON → for rendering in Deck.gl.\n    \n- Later, generate ForceAtlas2 layout from the same data for comparison.\n    \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to:\n\n- Write a script to extract the existing D3 layout (`x`, `y`, `r`) from your current `papers2.json` after it's processed?\n    \n- Or should I go straight into generating ForceAtlas2 coordinates?\n    \n\nYou choose ✨\n\n##### You said:\n\nboth\n\n###### ChatGPT said:\n\nD3 Node Coordinates\n\nUnable to display visualization\n\nThe current data file (`papers2.json`) does **not** contain precomputed coordinates (`x`, `y`, or `r`) for any nodes.\n\nThis confirms that the layout in your current UI is being **computed dynamically in the browser using D3.js**, specifically via the [`d3.pack`](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy#pack) layout algorithm. This is invoked here:\n\nts\n\nCopyEdit\n\n`pack<TreeNode>()   .size([3840, 2160])   (rootNode);`\n\nThis function computes `x`, `y`, and `r` in-place, after calling `rootNode.sum(...)`. These values are **not stored in the JSON** but exist in memory during runtime.\n\nIf you'd like to persist them (e.g. for Deck.gl), you'll need a script that:\n\n1. Recreates the D3 hierarchy and pack layout in Node.js or Python.\n    \n2. Writes the resulting `x`, `y`, `r` back into a JSON structure.\n    \n\nWould you like me to create that export script next?",

Instead, you should select specific, manageable, and highly relevant datasets to clearly demonstrate your agent-based methodology. Here are recommended approaches:\n\n---\n\n### 📌 **Recommended Datasets (Practical and Relevant):**\n\n#### 1. **PubMed Central Open Access Subset**\n\n- **Description:**  \n    ~8 million freely accessible full-text biomedical articles. Ideal for text mining, entity extraction, and relationship extraction.\n    \n- **Why Choose This?**  \n    Excellent starting point—large enough to be impactful, small enough to be manageable.\n    \n- **Link:**  \n    [PubMed Central Open Access Subset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/)\n    \n\n---\n\n#### 2. **DrugBank**\n\n- **Description:**  \n    Detailed, structured knowledge of drug compounds, targets, pharmacological data, and interactions.\n    \n- **Why Choose This?**  \n    Perfect for validating knowledge graph integration, target identification, and drug repurposing scenarios.\n    \n- **Link:**  \n    DrugBank\n    \n\n---\n\n#### 3. **ChEMBL Database**\n\n- **Description:**  \n    Bioactivity data for over 2 million compounds against targets, including drug efficacy, chemical structures, and clinical data.\n    \n- **Why Choose This?**  \n    Highly structured, reliable data—excellent for agent-based knowledge enrichment.\n    \n- **Link:**  \n    ChEMBL Database\n    \n\n---\n\n#### 4. **BioGRID**\n\n- **Description:**  \n    Interaction data (protein-protein, genetic) for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying drug interactions.\n    \n- **Why Choose This?**  \n    Useful to demonstrate reasoning capabilities and relationship extraction.\n    \n- **Link:**  \n    [BioGRID](https://thebiogrid.org/)\n    \n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Open Targets Platform**\n\n- **Description:**  \n    Integrated datasets covering target-disease relationships from genetics, genomics, drug evidence, and clinical trials.\n    \n- **Why Choose This?**  \n    Specifically designed for drug discovery, directly aligned with your goal.\n    \n- **Link:**  \n    Open Targets Platform\n    \n\n---\n\n### 🔬 **Recommended Dataset Combinations (Ideal for Nature):**\n\n|**Scenario**|**Datasets to Combine**|**Use Case**|\n|---|---|---|\n|**Novel Target Discovery**|PubMed Central OA + Open Targets Platform|Extraction, integration, validation|\n|**Drug Repurposing**|DrugBank + ChEMBL + PubMed OA|Entity linking, relationship extraction|\n|**Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction**|BioGRID + DrugBank + ChEMBL|Interaction prediction and validation|\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ **Why Not the Whole PubMed?**\n\n- **Computationally Intensive**: The full dataset (>36 million articles) requires substantial computational power and resources.\n    \n- **Time-consuming preprocessing**: Significant preprocessing (OCR errors, text normalization, parsing errors) required.\n    \n- **Complexity**: Large-scale integration can obscure initial clarity and impact unless explicitly necessary.\n    \n\nStarting with the **PubMed Central Open Access subset** ensures feasibility and impactful demonstration of your methodology. As you validate your methods, scaling up to larger subsets or full datasets can become feasible as a follow-up step.\n\n---\n\n### 🚀 **Suggested Initial Approach (for a Nature article)**:\n\n- **Phase 1**: Develop and validate your methodology using PubMed Central OA subset combined with DrugBank or ChEMBL.\n    \n- **Phase 2**: After validation, scale the approach to larger PubMed subsets or integrate with Open Targets Platform for comprehensive validation and robustness checks.\n    \n\n---\n\nWould you like more details or help setting up a specific workflow?",

      "content": "\n**Innocenti:** No more CUDA out-of-memory errors. That sounds like a challenge. Well then.  \n**Kumar:** Yeah.  \n**Innocenti:** We’ll see about that one, but I mean—they claim a lot with unified memory. Let’s test it out and see if that’s really true.  \n**Kumar:** Mm.  \n**Innocenti:** I’m not too convinced yet, but maybe, maybe.  \n**Kumar:** Well, it’s a lot. It’s a lot of memory anyway. So where do you want to start? I mean, I know you two guys, right? I think I’ve known you from your very first days at AstraZeneca.  \n**Innocenti:** Yeah, OK.  \n**Kumar:** But Laura, I haven’t met you before, so maybe quick intro—and maybe same on my side.  \n**Lopez Real:** Definitely. So I think your name sounds familiar to me, but I’m not really sure why. But yeah, I’ve been in AstraZeneca for three years. I used to be part of BioPharma R&D—actually working in Discovery Science in Cambridge. But now I’m based in Barcelona and working in Enterprise AI within Ignite as an Enterprise AI Architect, and I’m supporting these guys through the use-case interviews, gathering requirements, and just helping any way possible on this project, which is quite exciting.  \n**Kumar:** OK, cool. Well, I’m John Kumar. Slightly worrying that my name’s familiar but you don’t know why, so we can’t say if it’s a good or a bad thing. I’ve been at AstraZeneca for a while—I used to work in Chris’s team; that’s where I started full time.  \n**Lopez Real:** Mhm.  \n**Kumar:** Then I moved to Enterprise running the AI platforms, and then changed again. Now I’m in R&D as Head of Engineering at the Centre for AI. So yeah, maybe just about being here so long—you’ve heard of me.  \n**Lopez Real:** I hope that’s the other way, like the opposite process as I did. So yeah, it’s funny.  \n**Kumar:** So you have your business, so yeah, I went the other way. But yeah, I guess we both have a broad experience of AstraZeneca.  \n**Lopez Real:** Yeah. Nice meeting you.  \n**Innocenti:** All right, that sounds good. Usually the way we run this is just walking through the questionnaire a little bit, but we can keep it free-form. The questions mostly guide the discussion a bit. John, you guys are doing quite a lot in the Centre for AI. Any chance you can give us that context piece—what’s the main scope of what you deliver to the business?  \n**Kumar:** Mhm. So maybe you guys know—DS and AI is a central R&D function. Our remit is to act as a hub function, building anything common, reusable, and used by the various TAs. So we’re that specialised function. For instance, one major project we’re working on is M Lab, which sits in biologics engineering—designing novel antibodies using ML. Then we screen them with higher-throughput machines to measure affinity, so we work directly on business projects delivering value.\n\nGiven that, the Centre for AI has become a bit more engaged with AI itself—we have some ability now to chase projects around different areas of the business. Developing reusable components and driving our own roadmap of finding critical business challenges, then having time to deliver solutions.\n\nAnd in terms of capabilities and workloads that would be primarily intended to run on Polaris…\n\n**Innocenti:** I can give you a short-term view, I guess. The way I see Polaris—it’s like a big compute resource, right? And I think we should absolutely not make the same mistake we made with SCP in saying “oh, it’s a lot of compute, therefore it can do everything.” We should do only what belongs there. \n\n\nI think the capabilities we’re interested in running are: model training and model inference. That’s basically it. And I think the application layer should sit somewhere else unless there’s a good reason it needs to sit there.\n\nSo I’d be interested in seeing jobs that run across multiple GPUs on Polaris, but also deploying open-source models that need lots of RAM. There’s a lot we can do, right? We can start hosting a lot more than we can currently host. That’ll allow us to be less dependent on the big model providers. We could have a multi-step pipeline that calls different models depending on the size and scope of the task.\n\n**Innocenti:** Yeah.  \n**Kumar:** Training and maybe some serving, but now it’s a lot more like multi-GPU jobs.  \n**Innocenti:** Building allocations that use the…  \n**Kumar:** Agents, if you want. I would say some sort of unified inference-serving framework where we could host models in various formats—LLMs, antibody models for existence, things we’ve trained. It’s not suitable at all yet. You need something else. That serving framework should be flexible, maybe ten groups would own it. Quinn—80 billion requests per day, we don’t want that. We just want to understand how many calls come to that model, scale it appropriately.\n\nSo observability then becomes important. We’d like to know who’s using it, how much they’re using it, and turn it up or down.\n\n**Innocenti:** Is that done manually today or is it non-existent at the moment?  \n**Kumar:** It’s not like well—it’s non-existent. I mean, we can measure it. For LLM hosting we have access to 140 GB VRAM GPUs. We can host models on there; we can customize size and use LLM production stack, the Helm chart to do it—it has an observability plugin where you can see number of calls and metrics. It’s still in infancy, but it makes sense as a unified service for the company.\n\nHere’s the text from that screenshot (verbatim-style transcript):\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 10:33**  \n“Yeah. All right. I think that’s pretty good in terms of context. Richard, Laura, anything you were thinking in context? I have a little bit of prior experience with the CAI, so I know some, but is there anything on your end?”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 10:49**  \n“No, I think that was a very good introduction to what you want one out of Alaris and what we would be supporting for you here, so. Uh, that that that would be more on uh the the process.”\n\n**Lopez Real, Laura – 11:12**  \n“Definitely.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 11:19**  \n“Mm-hmm.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 11:19**  \n“So how do you work with the model training and development today? What systems, tools do you use here processes?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 11:29**  \n“Uh. So today we run on. Well, we run everywhere, but mostly on Azimuth. And so we prototype our—  \nOur models in notebooks, so that’s definitely a use case I think. So, you know, there you’ll like launch VS Code and you’ll be sitting on like a full GPU and it’ll be idling most of the time. Mozilla, you know, messing around with your code, changing, changing things, troubleshooting.”\n\n**Lopez Real, Laura – 12:12**  \n“Mm.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 12:19**  \n“Thanks.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 12:21**  \n“Ultimately, before we do any large runs, we want to package the software. So package the software committed, get it reviewed, push to main, build like a component out of it, which a component we’re calling like a containerized.  \nStand alone you know environment and set of commands to execute the model training and then we will run that by a Kubernetes job, either the Kubernetes PyTorch operator.  \nOr just a, you know, vanilla Kubernetes job. And then that’s how we run our long running stuff we’ve built.  \nA like a helper package around this. So it’s just a CLI, so it makes it much easier to fire off these jobs. So like if you’re familiar with Kubernetes, there’s like a ton of boilerplate YAML that uh, you have to have to submit something, so.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 13:22**  \n“Hmm.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 13:29**  \n“We’ve sort of made it into a CLI, so you can just say, you know, dash, dash, what class do you want to train on? Dash, dash, this many GPUs, et cetera, right? And then you can can fire off your job.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 13:45**  \n“So are then the full training of sort of packaged up in the in the container. So when you want to run a full scale training of I don’t know 4 GPUs on some set of database, all of that kind of baked into the Docker container with a launch command inside so that it when it’s deployed on Kubernetes that’s—  \nWhat runs and then it terminates.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 14:08**  \n“Uh. Yeah, or we will supply the command, right? So like there may be like a script in there and that’ll be like your command, like, you know, Python run, whatever.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 14:17**  \n“Yeah.  \nYeah.  \nOK, so that happens when you run more longer, longer uh activities, then it’s wrapped up. But when you develop, it’s through interactive notebooks.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 14:31**  \n“Yeah, and this is like.  \nThe least efficient thing what we do like when we have all our jobs packaged and we’re like churning through like a antibody discovery campaign or something like our GPU utilisation will be quite high cause it’s really just like you know, cranking the handle on sequences and stuff.  \nUm.  \nBut then like the development, the utilization is at maybe 5%, you know what I mean? It’s quite inefficient. So I don’t know how we get around that, like what our ways of working will be with a Polaris cluster if we.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 15:06**  \n“Yeah.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 15:08**  \n“Mm.  \nMhm.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 15:16**  \n“I would probably say it needs to be like a factory, right? And you need to get to this level of job submission before you submit something to the cluster. I don’t think we can support,  \nWell, I don’t know. You tell me, but it seems like a bad idea to support people just.  \nDoing nothing on these giant GPUs for.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 15:35**  \n“Maybe unless the fractional GPU comes to the rescue where they they essentially claim that you can emulate many GPUs through one, at least from the user perspective. So you get a timeshare on it and some of them could maybe be dedicated.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 15:35**  \n“No.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 15:42**  \n“Mm-hmm.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 15:55**  \n“To that.  \nOh.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 15:58**  \n“Yeah, I mean.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 15:59**  \n“But yeah.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 16:03**  \n“It’s probably worth doing. Well, I don’t know. It’s I’ll leave that to you guys to decide. I’ll tell you that, um, we do, we do both and very poor utilisation and the prototyping stuff.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 16:11**  \n“It.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 16:19**  \n“8.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 16:20**  \n“—”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 16:20**  \n“Yeah. And the types of modelling you guys do, are you touching entirely the full stack looking at the the questions on LLMS, vision, generative modelling, is that the full stack or are you mostly LLM based these days in the team?”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 16:26**  \n“OK.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 16:38**  \n“Uh, so we do.  \nMany things. So part of our work packages for next year revolve around training foundation models for like not LLM, so like protein, RNA, image based, cell based.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 16:56**  \n“Hmm.  \nImage based, yeah.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 17:02**  \n“So a wide variety.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 17:04**  \n“Yeah, OK. But that that that’s, that’s quite all right. So based on what I saw in CAI, you’re kind of across the space there, there’s been audio, there’s been images, all of these things. So I think that’s fair.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 17:09**  \n“Hello also.  \nYeah, so what? Yeah, I mean like LLM is definitely one thing. So like a foundation model looking at SAS code and then.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 17:20**  \n“Uh.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 17:33**  \n“Like, yeah, RNA, cell protein, biologics, that’s all in the roadmap just on the foundation model side. Then we have like all the agentic stuff that we’ll do, which will be dependent on inference as I explained to you earlier.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 17:41**  \n“Yeah.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 17:51**  \n“Uh.  \nMechanism of action, which I think, yeah, I’m not sure about that, but yes, many, many different things. I should also add that we have um.  \nLike when we run our antibody campaigns, it’s not just these protein language models, but we also use some of the structure prediction models, so similar to Alpha fold like bolts and we use those as.  \nOracles for our sequences. So basically it means we’re doing a lot of that sort of structure prediction, uh, routinely.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 18:33**  \n“Yeah, yeah, Bolts and Alpha Phone have come up in several other Uh interviews as well. So uh, it’s certainly an important Uh point.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 18:37**  \n“Yes.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 18:38**  \n“Hey.  \nThat would be good. I think like, I don’t know if NVIDIA has a NIM for that, but definitely be good to have some sort of bolt service on it that you could just.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 18:48**  \n“Yeah.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 19:01**  \n“Mm-hmm. Yeah, that would be good.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 19:05**  \n“I was thinking on you said you use azimuth. I assume that you're using the complete envelopes stack that they provide.  \nCould you maybe give us a a view of of how you work with that M locks in general or if it's based on the tools of estimate or if it's something you?  \nYou developed yourself.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 19:39**  \n“Yeah, we try not to develop much ourselves. So we use Azimuth. If we have like a DAG, you know, like multiple steps, we will use Kube load pipelines in order to execute that.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 19:53**  \n“OK.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 19:54**  \n“Um, for artifact management and experiment tracking, we’re using weights and biases currently. Uh, I think that also is gonna have this AI observability Weave it’s called. Um, I think that will be coming.  \nAnd I mean, yeah, then other services. So we like push all our software to Artifactory.  \n3.  \nBecause we have some large projects where like part of the team will be working on one package, part of the team will be working on another package, but there’ll be dependencies of each other. And so we pushed out of factory, you know, so that people are using latest staple versions and can easily install, right?”\n\n**20:27 – (Unidentified)**  \n“Hmm.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 20:41**  \n“The packages, so that’s that. Yeah, models we register on Weights and Biases as well.  \nWhat am I missing as part of ML OPS? I think that’s basically it.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 20:56**  \n“Maybe quickly tracing back a little bit, I guess maybe it falls under ML OPS, but you you mentioned the monitoring right with the GPU utilisation is how’s that done today? Is that looking through NVIDI SMI and being happy about it or or do you have something more?”\n\n**20:57 – (Unidentified)**  \n“Yes.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 20:58**  \n“OK.  \nMhm.  \nSo.  \nNo, no. So we bugged and bugged people, uh, to get the NVIDIA GPU operator on the past clusters. So now we can actually get like a live view of actual.  \nUh, GPU utilization like over different time frames like weeks, which has been very very useful and I think any anything Astra Zeneca does from now on should have this because.  \nEverybody complains that they don’t have enough GPUs or, you know, and it’s all, as far as I can tell, my suspicion was it was always like this dog ate my homework type excuse, right? Like.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 21:45**  \n“Mm.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 21:59**  \n“I.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 22:00**  \n“And that’s true. We are not suffering from a shortage of compute. We’re suffering from a shortage of utilization, as far as I can tell.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 22:11**  \n“—”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 22:11**  \n“I think I’m on board with that and and and Lydia raised a good point the other day. They have some sort of internal ways of working where you have to prove that you can saturate your GPUs before you get more right. And I don’t know, maybe that comes to Polaris, who knows? But it's.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 22:24**  \n“Yep.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 22:24**  \n“Oh.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 22:30**  \n“It’s good. So you have overview tools through in the NVIDIA software stack installed on the on the nodes. Is that fair to say? Yep.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 22:30**  \n“3.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 22:35**  \n“Yeah.  \nYes. So the daemon said every node that launches will get it and then we can and then it will report back to Prometheus or whatever it is.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 22:47**  \n“Yep.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 22:51**  \n“But it’s, I think it’s a must have for like maybe maybe we were lenient on the proving that you can 100% saturate them, but we should at least be able to to measure and try and see an improving trend for utilisation.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 23:09**  \n“Hitting.  \nNow that that would be very, very important of course, and I think it’s for us to investigate what the features are provided with the standards of first act on Claris. So if from AI does have this built in.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 23:19**  \n“Yeah.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 23:30**  \n“It it do have this supposedly better mechanism for scheduling CPU jobs.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 23:38**  \n“Mhm.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 23:43**  \n“OK, but that that’s good. So but John, are are you guys only on Azimuth at the moment or do you have some on demand AWS stuff going on or or how does that even work? I’m not, I’m completely naive when it comes to Azimuth to be honest.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 23:59**  \n“Well.  \nAzimuth currently has a like basically PaaS is the platform as a service team that does Kubernetes clusters and they can do it for you on on Prem resources or cloud resources and then Azimuth is just like a set of applications deployed on top of that.  \nSo we have clusters. We’re actually using three clusters now. One is cloud based, one is on Prem Gothenburg, one is on Prem US, but these are  \nDGX nodes and they’re out of their service lifetime right now. So basically we’re living on borrowed time with those. The cloud based one is currently in EU W one and we’re going to move that to EU N one because of the.  \nSustainability angle. Um. Hopefully that gives us access to the P fives and G sixes, which are, uh, slightly upspec from what you can get in Ireland. Um.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 25:10**  \n“I think that will happen. We’re doing the same in the in the deep learning team. So yes, those are available there.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 25:13**  \n“Mm.  \nBut um, yeah, I mean we hope we’re hoping to that Polaris will allow us to remove our dependency on the Um on Prem clusters and use that as our main computation workhorse, but we’ll probably.  \nKeep the cloud based one for like interactive work, some prototyping on small GPUs, that sort of thing and then firing. Hopefully we can fire off jobs to the big Polaris cluster when we need them.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 25:48**  \n“One of our ideas in terms of integrating platforms with Polaris is looking at the azimuth as an overlay top layer as you would on on Polaris too.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 25:48**  \n“Yeah.  \nYeah, that sounds good.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 26:08**  \n“To complement it with some of the functionality that’s not there. So an idea could be that Polaris is compute layer, the same as passes today, so.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 26:24**  \n“Mhm.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 26:24**  \n“You would be able to choose either past AWS or on premise or there would be a third choice which would be Polaris. So we we haven’t explored this in depth yet. It’s.  \nIt’s so far an idea and you as a user of Asimuth, do you have any suggestions, ideas that does that make sense for you?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 26:57**  \n“I mean, it makes sense for me, I think.  \nWhat I see on the ground is that Azimuth is sort of getting more and more users because of its flexibility. You know, it’s it’s gives you a bit more access to the lower layers of things than something like Domino.  \nAnd I think Domino isn’t really interoperable cause of the whole chip thing, but I think it it makes sense. But again, the interactive thing worries me like if you.  \nPut Azimuth on Polaris. Then you know people can open notebooks and sit on GPUs. So maybe you just need some of the tooling out of it. You know, like the Kubeflow pipelines.  \nYou know, because you might be doing pre-processing job and then a training job and you want to orchestrate this on that. So maybe you want KFP to do that. I think inference wise, Kubeflow is like not good. I think you need. I think you need like another solution.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 27:56**  \n“Mm.  \nOh, OK.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 28:12**  \n“For that, like, what is it? K serve? I don’t think it’s very good. So yeah, I don’t know. You’ll need to work out something better than Kube.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 28:23**  \n“Yeah, we really investigated and do what might make sense there. Thank you for your view. So on I think we we pretty much covered process. We we dived in a bit into.  \nPlatform and tech as well. One question on platforms. I know you’ve been a user of SP in the past. Is that anything you’re still using or is all your work today on the data?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 28:53**  \n“OK.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 29:02**  \n“Systems.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 29:04**  \n“I think people are doing something on SCP, but we’ve we’ve basically removed it from our stack.  \nBecause at the time I was having stability and availability problems and we had access to different computer through Azimuth. But it’s the software, right? That’s the thing. Like if you want, that’s what SCP has.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 29:21**  \n“Yes.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 29:33**  \n“Like Schrödinger and all these licensed software which keeps you there. Even the data isn’t as much of a problem as the software. So if maybe that’s something to do.  \nTo like negotiate the license terms or whatever of the software people so that you can use the SCP software on Polaris. Because I think the way it is right now R&D actually own the licenses to the software, but the SCP team maintained the.  \nLicense servers and so on.  \nUm, so it’s just easier to use the software.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 30:18**  \n“Oh, and as you know, the Polaris system is ARM based, so probably much of the commercial or licensed software will not be able to run out-of-the-box. Maybe there’s some that would reduce functionality, but.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 30:23**  \n“Hmm.  \nBut I did talk to.  \nYou guys both met Pia, the NVIDIA Rep over there. I talked to her and she was saying that they’re willing to do like work with third parties to get things to work right, like offering engineering assistance for third parties to get it to run on their clusters. So.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 30:43**  \n“Yeah, yes.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 30:58**  \n“Maybe there’s an exercise of like prioritising the software, seeing what will run, what won’t run, and then flagging a few candidates for development to NVIDIA.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 31:11**  \n“Oh, exactly. If there’s an interest for it, you can of course approach that.  \nVery good. So maybe we’re moving to our next section, which is on data.  \nSo maybe they’re, yeah, sorry.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 31:32**  \n“But.  \nBut I was just gonna say, well, like, yeah, we just need.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 31:37**  \n“OK.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 31:42**  \n“The ability to put.  \nThe most protected data type at AstraZeneca on there like so PII, let’s call it full track, trace and audit capabilities. I think that just if we just aim for that out-of-the-box, it’ll make everything so much easier.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 31:53**  \n“Mm.  \nYes, and that’s something we we have in our plans to support, but initially we may not be able to have the right level of security at the first delivery date. So there may be a phased approach where we.  \nOr quality initial operating capacity where you’d only be able to basically use public data and it would be for the first. We don’t know for for how long yet, but for the first period it would be public data only then.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 34:59**  \n“I don’t know. It’s always a grey area for me because some things are validated, like the central model registry which runs on Databricks now is supposed to be validated, meaning that if you have a GxP process and you’re—  \nPushing your models there and pulling them from there. You don’t need to revalidate that part of the process, so maybe there’s something similar that that is.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 35:28**  \n“But for for the initial use cases you have for for Claris, is any of that impacting any decisions for patients or operations?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 35:40**  \n“I think.  \nSo right now we split it up like this, like azimuth we do.  \nMost of our stuff and some private things, but because the data office has a very favorable view of AI Bench and a less favorable view of Azimuth for whatever reason, anything that.  \nRequires that PII data. We keep on AI Bench because it’s just a much easier process to get the data on there. In the future we’re looking to transfer those use cases maybe to Domino and like not be on AI Bench at all.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 36:16**  \n“Yeah.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 36:26**  \n“Um.  \nAnd then we’ll see. But yeah, we have a set of use cases that we could directly put on to Polaris that don’t require strictly confidential or GXP validated processes.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 36:43**  \n“But is it public? So fully public like that?”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 36:45**  \n“See.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 36:47**  \n“Is it? Probably that’s harder to find. Um.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 36:55**  \n“Yeah.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 36:55**  \n“Yes, I think that will be one of the requirements. It can’t be any asset asset because of the way the Polaris is going to be split among all of the the companies. Before all of the security measures are put in place, the only data that can be put there is anything that’s publicly available.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 37:05**  \n“Um.  \nUm.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 37:19**  \n“OK.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 37:20**  \n“Yeah, I don’t know. I mean, this is the thing, right? This is always the thing. You know, all sandboxes and stuff. We’re always like, yeah, you can use it, but you just can’t put any data in there. Well, OK, so so I guess you’re telling me I can’t use it.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 37:28**  \n“Hmm.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 37:33**  \n“Yeah.  \nYeah, a sandbox without any of the sand in it. You get the box.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 37:37**  \n“Yeah.  \nYeah, exactly. I mean, there’s stuff you can do, but it’s obviously very limited to that impact, right? Um.  \nLike even relatively benign things like training this foundation model for.  \nSAS code that would have to be all proprietary AZ code that goes in there. So while I think the risk is very small, you couldn’t call it public.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 38:10**  \n“That’s not on the switch, so.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 38:10**  \n“Hmm.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 38:17**  \n“If we look at the the stage where where you’re actually able to use the system and put your real data on there, you said you you have different kind of data types. One was the images I I remember and.  \nWell, a few others. So if we look at the size of of the data, you’re you’re going to transfer to Polaris be able to give an error of estimates like.  \nWhat’s the average type of, uh work? Uh, and what’s the largest piece of work? Uh, you’re going to transfer there?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 39:00**  \n“I don’t know. I can tell you guys something. I can tell you guys something.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 39:07**  \n“So it it we we just need it in the range like.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 39:11**  \n“Oh, it’s, um, it’s gonna be.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 39:12**  \n“Yeah.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 39:17**  \n“Like multiple terabytes. Um.  \nEasily like I’m we’re just doing a a clean up of our cluster.  \nAnd I’m I’m just looking for the number that came out of it, about how much data we have on it and it was relatively hilarious.  \n247 terabytes of data we had on our cluster, but I’m sure most that was like just scientists.  \nDoing copies and checkpoints and whatever else. Um, but that’s about the range, I guess. So you know, for a single training one, we’d probably want to transfer.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 40:07**  \n“Mhm.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 40:15**  \n“Like 10s to up to hundreds of terabytes of data and we would in the worst cases we need them on a fast file system, so like NVMe.  \nYou know on the on the note.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 40:31**  \n“Mm.  \nThat’s really useful information. Could could you maybe, I don’t know if you have any concrete example of of such a training. So, so say you want to train one of those foundational models you mentioned.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 40:52**  \n“Mhm.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 40:52**  \n“Um.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 40:54**  \n“I think the the worst ones were the audio ones. So we have like, uh, we were doing training for counting coughs. So you’d have like recording of people coughing that you’d have to process. So these are relatively.  \nLike large audio files um and then they would would have to be on a very fast disk right? The faster the better in order to make this work. Um and the data side there was.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 41:10**  \n“Mhm.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 41:26**  \n“Sort of 10 plus terabytes for a single training one. That was like the most technically challenging one in terms of data speed and access.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 41:38**  \n“That’s so that’s very interesting. Would you mind me sharing that with the because they’ve been asking about different use cases that use a lot of data in their their.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 41:53**  \n“Mhm.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 41:54**  \n“Single run so.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 41:56**  \n“Yeah, I can get some more, get some more details on that. But then we also have like, you know, peptide, not peptide, like antibody training runs, which are pretty they have a bit and they’re just sequences. It’s just like text data, so,  \nUh, but it’s a lot.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 42:18**  \n“And in terms of output, John, are you guys generating a lot of data that you need to transfer out or is it mostly the model itself which is going to be a few gigabytes worth of of storage and then maybe some predictions, but are the predictions large or you know the output data is that large?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 42:38**  \n“Um.  \nWell, not as large as the input data, hopefully.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 42:43**  \n“Terabytes, Uh, gigabytes. What range do you think?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 42:49**  \n“I don’t know like a lot of it’s multi step so.  \nYou know, like we’ll generate, the end goal will be to generate a library of 100,000 sequences or you know around that order. First step is to generate like a million. So you know that I guess it’s still pretty small in terms of data.  \nUm.  \nI think MB scale outputs for actual data, but then like um, as you say gigabytes for the models and this can there’s a lot of checkpointing that needs to happen, so um.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 43:25**  \n“OK.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 43:30**  \n“You know.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 41:30**  \n“You know.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 43:30**  \n“Yeah, that’s fair. But usually you’re only interested in a few of the checkpoints and and each of those are not too big, I suppose.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 43:38**  \n“Yeah, but I guess the way we’d wanna work is like you just set up weights and biases or equivalent in your software and then every checkpoint gets shipped to your uh artifact management service and then  \nYou know you can delete them, but at least they’re there so you can watch the training output metrics and then pick pick the checkpoint you want and delete the rest. But it’s still a lot of egress, if you know what I mean from that.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 44:10**  \n“Yeah.  \nAny notion on the on on that number that you think would be required to get out of there? I mean it’s OK to say no, I don’t know, but.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 44:23**  \n“Yeah, and I got no real feel for it. Uh.  \nBut it’s probably only gonna get more than what we have now, because I guess now my feeling is these practices are not very widespread at AZ of, you know, integrating with experiment tracking and artifact management. Like people tend to just operate in these of volumes.  \nYou know, essentially, um. But I think this is a way of working that should be brought in. Um.  \nAnd Polaris might be a good, good time to do it because I think everything has value, right? And uh, doing things in a sort of systematic way helps us, um, better track what we’re doing scientifically.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 45:15**  \n“All right. I think that’s all good. Should we carry on? In the interest of time, we don’t have too much. We already touched a little bit on model development and and things. John, you guys use notebooks, etcetera, and then you submit jobs in a way to to the kube clusters.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 45:20**  \n“Mhm.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 45:33**  \n“Um, anything else on that front? The ways of working with?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 45:33**  \n“OK.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 45:39**  \n“That that’s worth mentioning.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 45:41**  \n“Not really, just we we use VS code.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 45:43**  \n“So.  \nDo you guys try and remote attach and things like that or do you just develop through it and then uh you know notebook through the web interface I suppose, but.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 45:57**  \n“We can support all of those, I think.  \nThe idea is to have less depend. Yeah, so we just want people to be able to either use their their laptop or azimuth like through the web, but ultimately to be able to submit jobs, uh, when they need to actually train something.  \nFor real.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 46:23**  \n“Yep.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 46:34**  \n“And then any preference on how that should be done, the submission of the OPS, anything there that that’s a pain point today or or anything like that?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 46:34**  \n“Yeah, well, like I mentioned, just like the CLI approach has been fairly useful because it it can be done both programmatically or, you know, manually just firing it off from the command line, I think.  \nAnything where there’s a lot of YAML tends to get a bit of friction from the AI scientist.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 47:03**  \n“Alright, alright. Um.  \nSo maybe anything else there from any of you on the call with model development? I think we’ve touched on essentially all of this already. The public data resource scheduling is not super important for you guys since you can do it a little bit on demand.  \nWith the clusters, but maybe then inference is an interesting topic with you did say that you did have some serving needs. So in terms of latency and stuff, do you have demand to be able to have a live service running all the time?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 47:34**  \n“Hmm.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 47:44**  \n“Do you get batch submissions of data that you’re going to process and then hand over? How does that look like for you at the moment?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 47:53**  \n“Um.  \nSo.  \nIt’s hard to say, I mean for.  \nSo there’s two main worlds we live in, like the protein engineering world and the agentic world, and these all have requirements somewhat different about latency, throughput and concurrency.  \nSo with the protein, you might want to serve a model, get it to predict your 100,000 sequences or whatever, but time isn’t really.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 48:23**  \n“Yes.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 48:38**  \n“That much of an issue, right? Like you can sort of fire it off, we can go do something in the background. So that could be like async even. But for the agentic stuff, like it’s all sort of pipelines and cycles, right? And like one call is blocking the next call, if you know what I mean.  \nI mean, so we’ve even, we’re even doing a little bit of work with what they’re called Cerberus because they have these ultra fast inference services.  \nAnd that’s because it’s better for the Agentic, right? Like the faster you can do a loop, the faster you can like move on to the next loop and so on. Do you know what I mean? So that that means latency throughput, possibly concurrency once Agentic starts to kick off. So that would be the most demanding.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 49:20**  \n“Mm.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 49:35**  \n“In terms of inference needs and the model’s a big, right? They’re like, you know.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 49:37**  \n“OK.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 49:42**  \n“Would you envision those to be run? So when they’re fully developed and and and trained, would they? Would this be something you would want to run during development or is this when you train the agents, the agent system and you set things up?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 49:43**  \n“Unreally reboot.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 49:58**  \n“Do you need all of these, this throughput and concurrency at that phase, or would you only need it when you actually deploy the thing you’re happy with?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 50:08**  \n“I think it’s only when you deploy it, right? Like when you’re experimenting, you’ll obviously be.  \nTesting more for you know, and it does it reason correctly. Does it get to the right answer? Does it pass the benchmark? These sorts of things, you know, swapping models in and out and then once you have something that.  \nBuild the task and you can optimize on these things.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 50:44**  \n“So would would any of these inference workloads be sensitive in terms of availability? I think that might be a challenge in Polaris since it’s.  \nQuite a sensitive environment and it’s a single system, so it may be that the cannot guarantee 100% production.  \nAvailability of the service nodes may go down and they may be need for service and so forth quite regularly. Would you have any critical services depending on on this inference or would it be acceptable if it goes down?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 51:25**  \n“Yeah.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 51:34**  \n“You can do a fall back to some other inference service.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 51:38**  \n“Well, you know, we’re R&D. Nothing, nothing we do really matters that much. You know, things can go down. It’s not like it’s manufacturing or something like that.  \nUm.  \nI don’t know. They’re they’re not critical at this stage. Maybe they get there, but I would say we have.  \nNo really hard uptime requirements, right?”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 52:09**  \n“Of course we we’ll do the best we we can with with the whole work we’ve got, but it’s it’s a single system. So that’s why why I I need to raise it if you have any demands on high availability of the interference service.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 52:28**  \n“I mean, I think that’s when we would get into like, you know, dedicated serving like Cerberus, right? Because then you just, OK, that spinning wafer of silicon belongs to us and.  \nAnd it just, you know, spits out what we needed to, whereas this is more a multipurposing, right? So you never know what job you’re gonna be alongside and you’re gonna lock up your node or or whatever.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 52:58**  \n“Yeah.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 53:01**  \n“All good. I think we are almost running out of time. So let’s maybe touch on two critical questions that we also want to talk about in terms of collaboration externally. John, do you have that today? So you know other universities or anything like that?  \nBecause most likely that will be tricky to do with Polaris in in the short term.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 53:24**  \n“Um.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 53:28**  \n“Nothing, nothing on the critical path, right? We may have, you know, collaborations time to time, but right now most of our use cases are AZ internal.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 53:38**  \n“Yeah, and and you don’t need, uh, external parties, direct access to compute resources at this point in time.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 53:45**  \n“No.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 53:48**  \n“All right. And then maybe I’m, I’m skipping ahead, but the the last question is with regards to money as they say, how’s your team in the funding side going forward, John, is that anything you have insight into?”\n\n**Kumar, John – 54:04**  \n“I mean, we need like, we need a model, right? Like, I think it’s.  \nI mean, you know how it is, right? Like, I like we have the amount of money we have now, but we like I asked tom-tom asked Jim, Jim asked Sharon if it’s important enough, some money appears, right? But right now we have no model about.  \nOur chargeback is gonna work on this Polaris, so we can’t estimate. So I have a compute budget next year of 700,000 to a million.  \nBut I have other things I have to keep running until Blaz becomes available, which is like when so I have to keep other services ongoing and then have some transition period and so on.  \nYou know, once we have the model, we can, we can work out what we need, if we’re short or what. But I mean, I know how much money they want me to spend next year, if that’s realistic or not, I don’t know.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 55:09**  \n“Hmm.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 55:14**  \n“You guys tell me.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 55:14**  \n“Yeah, but you already have a compute budget, so technically speaking you could divert funds from there to say Polaris because at the end of the day it’s training. Obviously you want to know exactly what the cost is, etcetera, but compute resource is already something that that is in demand in your team.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 55:24**  \n“Hello.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 55:27**  \n“OK.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 55:28**  \n“Cool.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 55:32**  \n“Yeah, I mean, I am predicting somewhat naively that that this comes out cheaper for us overall, right? Because.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 55:33**  \n“7.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 55:44**  \n“It’s paid for upfront and if it comes out as like more expensive than a reserved P5 N node in EU N one, then we may simply not move. Do you know what I mean? That’s the.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 56:01**  \n“Yeah.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 56:01**  \n“That’s the the reality of it. But if it comes out cheaper, yes, I’d love to take advantage of these, these new notes. I’m happy to to pay for it on a on a user page basis. I think that’s important, right? Otherwise people just.  \nGet into the SCP situation where people just, you know, **** away resource, resource for nothing.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 55:32**  \n“Yeah, I mean, I am predicting somewhat naively that this comes out cheaper for us overall, right? Because.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 55:33**  \n“7.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 55:44**  \n“It’s paid for upfront and if it comes out as like more expensive than a reserved P5 N node in EU N one, then we may simply not move.

Yeah, we’re we’re at the, uh, the full hour mark. Any questions from Uh, Richard Laura?”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 56:32**  \n“Mhm.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 56:42**  \n“Yeah.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 56:43**  \n“Appreciate.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 56:45**  \n“Thanks guys. I’m always around. So if you have any other questions you you can reach out. I think we’re gonna get something of a steering committee or something together as well. So I’m sure this might be the last time we we talk about it.”\n\n**Innocenti, Christopher – 57:02**  \n“That sounds about right to me as well. All right. Thank you very much, John. Have a good rest of your day. Thank you, guys.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 57:05**  \n“All right. Have a great day, everyone.”\n\n**Lopez Real, Laura – 57:08**  \n“Thanks a lot, John. Take care. Bye.”\n\n**Andersson, Richard – 57:08**  \n“Yep. Thanks everyone.”\n\n**Kumar, John – 57:11**  \n“Bye.”",

We need to agree on whether we want one vs. several blueprints (one for the python library, and a separate one for the Ragify services).\n3. Need to clarify the following information\n\t1. How will the Solution be Serviced in BAU, and does the Service Design meet the requirements for a Minimal Viable Service? \n\t2. Is this delivered as a service or as part of Platform delivery? \n\t3. Has ‘Acceptance to Service’ been involved? Are there any changes to existing Services?  \n\t4. Names of teams who would be supporting the solution. Please clarify if multiple teams are involved and which solution components are supported by which team(s)._ (2.10)\n4. Who is going to register the application in Service Now?\n\t1. This is required for section 3.2 of the blueprint:\n5. Who is going to own the process of PIA and RID?\n\t1. PIA\n\t\t- According to this page we won't require to raise a PIA for Ragify: https://confluence.astrazeneca.com/display/AIS/Generative+AI+Process+Guidance\n\t\t- ![[Pasted image 20250627141509.png]]\n\t\t- Note the sentence: **\"If your project will not involve any personal data processing you will not need to raise a PIA.\"**\n\t2. Risk Impact Determination (RID)\n\t\t1. **Important dependency**: To raise a RID it is important to have the application registered in SNOW.\n\t\t2. https://astrazeneca-eqv.veevavault.com/ui/#doc_info/1104855/12/0?state_type=steady_state__v&anQS=page3&annotate=false this is the SOP for RID\n\t\t3. This is the application portal: https://azcollaboration.sharepoint.com/sites/TSC241/Pages/HomePage.aspx\n\t\n**Actions for Laura**\n- Initiate cyber security analysis\n- Document the Architecture decisions on the Architecture Decision Log",

      "content": "\n### Essay 1\n\n**Prompt:**  \n“In recent years, environmental concerns have become more important than economic growth. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.”\n\n> **Introduction**  \n> In recent years, the tension between environmental protection and economic expansion has become increasingly pronounced. While some argue that economic growth is the driving force behind societal progress, others maintain that preserving our planet should take precedence. This essay will examine both perspectives and explain why I believe that environmental concerns must guide future development.\n> \n> **Body Paragraph 1**  \n> Proponents of prioritising economic growth claim that a robust economy generates jobs, improves living standards and funds public services. For instance, during the post-2008 recovery, countries that focused on industrial output saw unemployment rates fall significantly. This suggests that a thriving economy is indispensable for individual prosperity and social stability.\n> \n> **Body Paragraph 2**  \n> On the other hand, advocates of environmental stewardship contend that unchecked growth leads to resource depletion and irreversible damage. A case in point is the Amazon rainforest, where deforestation for agricultural expansion has accelerated biodiversity loss. If current trends continue, essential ecosystems may collapse, undermining long-term human well-being.\n> \n> **Conclusion**  \n> In conclusion, although economic growth undoubtedly brings tangible benefits, I firmly believe that it should not come at the expense of the environment. Sustainable development models—such as green technologies and circular economies—offer a balanced path forward, ensuring both prosperity and the planet’s health.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 2\n\n**Prompt:**  \n“The number of people working remotely has surged. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages and give your opinion.”\n\n> **Introduction**  \n> The shift towards remote working has accelerated in recent years, especially following the global pandemic. While many applaud the flexibility it offers, critics warn of potential drawbacks. This essay will explore both sides before arguing that, on balance, remote work represents a positive development.\n> \n> **Body Paragraph 1**  \n> Advocates emphasise that working from home saves commuting time and increases productivity. Without a daily journey, employees often enjoy a better work–life balance, which can reduce stress. For example, a 2023 survey found that 70 percent of remote workers felt more motivated and focused in their own environment.\n> \n> **Body Paragraph 2**  \n> Conversely, opponents argue that remote work can lead to isolation and blurred boundaries between professional and personal life. Many report struggling to “switch off” after logging off, leading to longer working hours and burnout. In addition, informal office interactions that foster creativity and team cohesion are harder to replicate online.\n> \n> **Conclusion**  \n> In conclusion, while remote working presents challenges—such as potential loneliness and overwork—its advantages in flexibility and efficiency outweigh the negatives. By establishing clear policies and encouraging regular virtual or face-to-face meetups, organisations can harness the best of both worlds.\n\n---\n\n### Essay 3\n\n**Prompt:**  \n“Some people say social media enhances communication, while others believe it damages real-life relationships. Discuss both views and give your opinion.”\n\n> **Introduction**  \n> The advent of social media has revolutionised how we connect, yet its impact on genuine relationships remains contentious. Some maintain that platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp enrich communication, whereas others argue they erode face-to-face bonds. This essay will consider both viewpoints before concluding that, used responsibly, social media can complement real-life interactions.\n> \n> **Body Paragraph 1**  \n> Supporters contend that social media breaks down geographical barriers, enabling instant contact with friends and family worldwide. For instance, video calls on Facebook or WhatsApp allow users to share milestones in real time, fostering a sense of closeness. Moreover, interest-based online communities offer emotional support to those who might feel isolated locally.\n> \n> **Body Paragraph 2**  \n> Conversely, critics warn that excessive online engagement can undermine interpersonal skills. People may substitute genuine conversations with superficial “likes” or brief comments, leading to misunderstandings. A study in 2024 revealed that heavy social media users reported lower levels of empathy and found it harder to maintain eye contact during in-person meetings.\n> \n> **Conclusion**  \n> In conclusion, although social media poses risks to authentic communication, I believe its benefits prevail when users apply it judiciously. By setting screen-time limits and prioritising face-to-face encounters, individuals can enjoy digital connectivity without sacrificing real-world relationships.",

      "content": "**Preparing examples for emails and reviews**\n\nThe user wants examples of emails and reviews with high scores, similar to the essay examples provided earlier. I need to prepare three examples for each task type, with each example being between 220-260 words. This is the standard length for C1 Advanced writing tasks. I'll make sure each of the emails and reviews showcases the highest possible quality to demonstrate what would earn top marks. I think I'll aim to keep things clear and concise but impactful.\n\n**Planning email and review examples**\n\nThe user probably wants three examples for emails and three for reviews, to mirror the task format. Each example should follow the correct structure—emails should include salutation, introduction, body with bullet points, closing, and signature. Reviews should have a title, paragraph structure for strengths, weaknesses, and a conclusion with a rating. I'll keep word counts between 220-260 words to match the guidelines. Let’s create realistic, varied prompts for these: e.g., writing to complain about noise, requesting course details, or thanking someone for a job opportunity.\n\n**Drafting email example**\n\nI need to expand the initial email to fit within the required 220-260 word count range. The content should be relevant and detailed without losing formality or purpose. Here’s the plan: I'll start by adding an introductory paragraph about the writer's interest in the conference. Then, I’ll build out more detailed inquiries like payment methods, accommodations, and student discounts. After revising, I should have a refined email closer to 220-260 words that feels comprehensive yet polite, offering more professional context and explaining the significance of the event to the user's career.\n\nThought for 29 seconds\n\nBelow are three high-scoring **Letter/Email** examples (≈230–250 words) followed by three **Review** examples (≈230–250 words), each carefully following the Part 2 templates.\n\n---\n\n## Letter / Email Examples\n\n### Example 1 (Formal – Conference Enquiry)\n\n```text\nDear Dr. Thompson,\n\nI hope you are well. I recently completed my Master’s in Mechatronics at the University of Madrid and plan to attend the International Robotics Conference in Rome this July. As an aspiring robotics engineer focused on human–robot collaboration, I would be extremely grateful if you could provide further information regarding the event.\n\nSpecifically, I would appreciate your assistance with the following:\n- Registration procedure and deadlines: Are there any early-bird rates, and what is the final date for sign-up?\n- Payment options: Which methods are accepted and in which currencies? Is bank transfer available?\n- Student concessions: Does the organising committee offer reduced fees or scholarships for recent graduates?\n- Workshop opportunities: Could you share submission guidelines for presenting research?\n\nFurthermore, attending sessions on AI-driven control systems would greatly inform my upcoming doctoral research. If you require any documentation, such as proof of student status or academic transcripts, I would be happy to provide them.\n\nThank you in advance for your time and support. I look forward to your response and to the chance to engage with leading experts in the field.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMaría González  \nResearch Assistant, Department of Mechanical Engineering  \nAstraZeneca, Madrid  \nmaria.gonzalez@astrazeneca.com | +34 600 123 456\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example 2 (Informal – Colleague Collaboration)\n\n```text\nHi Alex,\n\nI hope you’re doing well! I’m organising a student-led workshop on sustainable packaging next month and would love for you to join the planning team. Your expertise in materials science would be invaluable.\n\nCould you:\n- Brainstorm eco-friendly material options at our kick-off meeting on 12 May?\n- Help draft a brief outline of hands-on activities for participants?\n- Suggest potential guest speakers or industry contacts?\n\nWe’ll meet every Wednesday at 5 pm in Lab 3, but if another time suits you better, just let me know. Also, feel free to propose any creative ideas you have in mind.\n\nThanks a million for considering this—I know your input will make the workshop a success. Let me know if you need more details or have any questions.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSara López  \nSustainability Group, University of Valencia  \nsara.lopez@uv.es | +34 612 345 678\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example 3 (Semi-Formal – Office Facilities Complaint)\n\n```text\nDear Ms. Carter,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express concerns regarding the heating system at our office on King Street. Over the past month, the radiators have intermittently failed, causing temperatures to drop below 16 °C and affecting staff comfort and productivity.\n\nCould you please:\n- Arrange for a full inspection and repair of the heating system as soon as possible.\n- Provide an estimated timeline for completion.\n- Advise whether any compensation or adjustments will be applied due to the disruption.\n- Recommend any interim measures we can implement to maintain a safe working temperature.\n\nTo illustrate, on 11 and 14 April the heating switched off mid-morning, forcing staff to wear coats indoors and take unscheduled breaks. Given the precision required for our lab equipment, consistent climate control is essential.\n\nWe greatly value the working environment you provide and trust you will address this issue promptly. If you need further information or wish to visit the premises, please let me know.\n\nThank you for your swift attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJohn Ramírez  \nOffice Manager, GreenWave Innovations  \njohn.ramirez@greenwave.com | +44 7700 900 123\n```\n\n---\n\n## Review Examples\n\n### Example 1: Restaurant Review\n\n```text\n**Title:** “A Culinary Journey at La Ruta”\n\n**Introduction:**  \nHaving recently dined at **La Ruta**, I was captivated by both the inventive menu and warm atmosphere. In this review, I’ll outline the main strengths and a couple of minor drawbacks.\n\n**Strengths:**  \n1. **Ambience:** The rustic decor, soft lighting and gentle flamenco guitar created an intimate setting, perfect for both dates and small groups.  \n2. **Service:** Staff were attentive without being intrusive. For instance, our server anticipated our water and bread refills before we asked.  \n3. **Signature Dishes:** The saffron-infused paella was a standout—rice was perfectly al dente and seafood exceptionally fresh.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n1. **Pricing:** On the downside, main courses average €28–€32, which may deter budget-minded diners.  \n2. **Dessert Selection:** While the crema catalana was delightful, the overall dessert menu felt limited; I would have welcomed a fruit-based option.\n\n**Conclusion & Rating:**  \nOverall, I would give **La Ruta** **4 ½ out of 5 stars**. I would highly recommend it to food enthusiasts seeking authentic yet creative Andalusian cuisine, provided they’re prepared for slightly higher prices.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example 2: Tech Product Review\n\n```text\n**Title:** “Why the BrightVision X5 Shines Bright”\n\n**Introduction:**  \nHaving tested the **BrightVision X5** smartphone for two weeks, I was impressed by its sleek design and powerful performance. This review covers its primary benefits and a few caveats.\n\n**Strengths:**  \n1. **Display Quality:** The 6.7″ OLED screen delivers vivid colours and deep blacks. For example, HDR videos looked exceptionally crisp even in bright daylight.  \n2. **Battery Life:** With moderate use, the X5 easily lasted a full day—and fast-charging achieved 60 % in just 25 minutes.  \n3. **Camera Versatility:** Its 108 MP main lens and ultra-wide module captured stunning landscapes and sharp low-light portraits.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n1. **Price Point:** At €999, it undercuts some flagship rivals but remains a significant investment for budget-conscious buyers.  \n2. **Software Bloat:** A handful of preinstalled apps, such as carrier-branded games, required manual removal and were difficult to uninstall completely.\n\n**Conclusion & Rating:**  \nOverall, I would give the **BrightVision X5** **4 out of 5 stars**. I would recommend it to tech-savvy users who prioritise camera performance and battery longevity, provided they can overlook the occasional software clutter.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example 3: Theatre Performance Review\n\n```text\n**Title:** “An Enchanting Night with ‘Midnight Sonata’”\n\n**Introduction:**  \nHaving attended the premiere of **‘Midnight Sonata’** at the Apollo Theatre, I was struck by its ambitious staging and emotive score. In this review, I’ll examine its highs and a couple of areas for improvement.\n\n**Strengths:**  \n1. **Music & Sound Design:** The live orchestra brought Rachmaninoff’s themes to life, with seamless transitions and rich acoustics.  \n2. **Set & Lighting:** Innovative rotating platforms and dynamic lighting shifts created dramatic contrasts, especially during the climactic third act.  \n3. **Lead Performance:** Sofia Mendes delivered a powerful portrayal of the protagonist, her expressive vocals conveying deep emotional nuance.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n1. **Pacing:** On the downside, the second act felt overlong, with repetitive dialogue that slightly stalled the momentum.  \n2. **Supporting Cast Balance:** A few ensemble members lacked vocal projection, making some choral passages sound uneven.\n\n**Conclusion & Rating:**  \nOverall, I would give **‘Midnight Sonata’** **4 out of 5 stars**. I would highly recommend it to classical-music aficionados and theatre-lovers seeking a visually stunning, musically rich experience, bearing in mind the minor pacing issues.\n```\n\n---\n\nEach example:\n\n- Meets the **220–260 word** range.\n    \n- Uses clear **structure**, varied **linkers** (e.g. “For instance,” “On the downside,” “Overall”), a mix of **complex** and **simple** sentences, and task-appropriate **register**.\n    \n- Fully addresses the task bullets and demonstrates high-level **coherence**, **lexical resource**, and **grammar range & accuracy**.

      "tags": [],
      "content": "## 🔒 Executive Security Assessment\n\n**Scope:** Domino SaaS Control Plane (AWS-hosted by vendor) connected to AstraZeneca-controlled private data planes (on-prem + AWS).  \n**Objective:** Identify potential data privacy and security risks in the proposed architecture.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ 1. Potential Security Breaches & Concerns\n\n### **1.1 Control Plane – Data Plane Trust Boundary**\n\n- **Concern:** The control plane, operated by the vendor, holds orchestration authority and metadata visibility across AstraZeneca workloads.  \n    → **Risk:** Compromise of the control plane (via supply-chain or insider threat) could enable _indirect control_ over AstraZeneca compute environments.  \n    → **Impact:** Unauthorized scheduling or access to workload metadata; lateral movement risk if plane authentication tokens are misused.\n\n### **1.2 Data Exfiltration via Domino File System (DFS)**\n\n- **Concern:** File synchronization between data planes and control plane S3 buckets may transmit arbitrary user-generated files.  \n    → **Risk:** PII/PHI or proprietary data unintentionally leaving the regulated boundary.  \n    → **Impact:** Breach of data residency or regulatory frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, GxP).\n\n### **1.3 Git Repository Integration**\n\n- **Concern:** Control plane accesses Git repositories containing project code.  \n    → **Risk:** Sensitive datasets or credentials accidentally committed could be pulled into the vendor environment.  \n    → **Impact:** Leakage of internal IP or secret material; indirect credential exposure.\n    \n\n### **1.4 Model Monitoring Telemetry**\n\n- **Concern:** Feature and prediction telemetry is transmitted to the SaaS control plane for drift detection.  \n    → **Risk:** Even sanitized features may encode quasi-identifiers (e.g., hashed IDs, embeddings) enabling re-identification.  \n    → **Impact:** Privacy breach, regulatory non-compliance, or exposure of derived business intelligence.\n    \n\n### **1.5 MLflow & Flyte Artifacts**\n\n- **Concern:** Both systems log artifacts to control-plane S3 storage.  \n    → **Risk:** User code could upload full datasets or model inputs/outputs; S3 misconfiguration could expose this externally.  \n    → **Impact:** Data leakage to vendor or third parties; GxP/GDPR breach.\n    \n\n### **1.6 Execution Logs (stdout/stderr)**\n\n- **Concern:** Logs containing sensitive payloads or stack traces are automatically collected and stored in vendor S3.  \n    → **Risk:** Sensitive strings, identifiers, or query results leak via log ingestion.  \n    → **Impact:** Low-visibility exfiltration path, difficult to monitor post-factum.\n    \n\n### **1.7 Supply-Chain / Update Cadence**\n\n- **Concern:** Control plane receives weekly (or biannual GxP) updates managed solely by Domino.  \n    → **Risk:** Code injection or compromised update pipeline could propagate to AstraZeneca data planes.  \n    → **Impact:** Enterprise-wide compromise of compute orchestration via legitimate channel.\n    \n\n### **1.8 API & Identity Federation**\n\n- **Concern:** Cross-plane authentication tokens or API credentials used between AstraZeneca and Domino endpoints.  \n    → **Risk:** If these credentials are reused, cached, or inadequately scoped, attackers could pivot between clouds.  \n    → **Impact:** Unauthorized command execution or job scheduling.\n    \n\n### **1.9 Lack of Native E2E Encryption Assurance**\n\n- **Concern:** The document doesn’t explicitly state whether all inter-plane channels use **mutual TLS with cert rotation**, or if data-at-rest in control plane S3 is **client-side encrypted** with AstraZeneca-owned keys.  \n    → **Risk:** Vendor-managed encryption could expose data to lawful access requests or insider compromise.  \n    → **Impact:** Breach of confidentiality under shared responsibility model.\n    \n\n### **1.10 Telemetry and Metadata Aggregation**\n\n- **Concern:** Vendor retains detailed metadata (project IDs, timestamps, user IDs, resource usage).  \n    → **Risk:** Metadata correlation can leak operational patterns or model IP (“model-inference leakage”).  \n    → **Impact:** Competitive intelligence or insider threat vector.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 🧭 2. Recommendations\n\n|#|Recommendation|Rationale|\n|---|---|---|\n|**1**|**Apply a strict “Metadata-Only” policy** — forbid any feature that uploads files, telemetry, or artifacts to the SaaS plane.|Eliminates egress paths (DFS, MLflow, Flyte, Monitoring).|\n|**2**|**Deploy a dedicated “GxP-Hardened” SaaS tenant** with isolated VPC, private endpoint connectivity, and AstraZeneca-managed KMS keys for S3 encryption.|Reduces vendor visibility and strengthens key control.|\n|**3**|**Mandate network isolation and scoped IAM roles** — no control plane network peering; enforce least privilege for inter-plane APIs.|Prevents lateral movement from control to data planes.|\n|**4**|**Implement egress inspection and DLP** at the data plane boundary for outbound traffic to Domino endpoints.|Detects accidental sensitive data transfers.|\n|**5**|**Integrate Domino control plane with AstraZeneca SSO via SAML/OIDC** and enforce MFA + just-in-time provisioning.|Strengthens identity governance and off-boarding control.|\n|**6**|**Require mutual TLS (mTLS) and certificate rotation** for all control-plane/data-plane communication channels.|Mitigates MITM and impersonation risks.|\n|**7**|**Institute pre-deployment security validation of Domino updates (especially GxP)** — including signed binaries and change logs.|Reduces supply-chain risk from vendor-managed upgrades.|\n|**8**|**Disable default logging of stdout/stderr to vendor S3**, or apply automatic log redaction.|Prevents unintentional leakage of sensitive strings.|\n|**9**|**Centralize audit trail ingestion** into AstraZeneca’s SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, etc.) via API integration.|Ensures enterprise visibility over vendor activity.|\n|**10**|**Negotiate Data Processing Addendum (DPA) with right to audit** vendor’s SaaS environment, including sub-processor disclosure.|Strengthens contractual assurance and compliance oversight.|\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 3. Strategic Posture Recommendation\n\nFor highly regulated workloads (clinical, patient-linked, or IP-sensitive):\n\n- Operate **Domino in “Private Control Plane Mode”** (fully AstraZeneca-managed) or **Domino Cloud for Life Sciences with all data-egress features disabled.**\n    \n- Treat the SaaS control plane strictly as an **orchestration and metadata manager** — not as a data store.\n    \n- Adopt a **zero-trust posture** across vendor boundaries: every API call, artifact, and telemetry channel must be authenticated, encrypted, and logged.\n    \n\n---\n\n### ✅ Bottom Line\n\nThe proposed hybrid model is _architecturally sound_ for metadata-driven orchestration but **carries multiple latent egress and supply-chain risks**. With appropriate **feature hardening, encryption ownership, DLP, and identity governance**, it can meet AstraZeneca’s data privacy obligations — but **default SaaS configurations are insufficient for regulated data without modification.**",

      "tags": [],
      "content": "# Executive summary\n\n- **Purpose:** Domino briefed AZ on the **option to move the Domino control plane to Domino-managed hosting** (while keeping AZ data planes in AZ). This option **didn’t exist when AZ first deployed** Domino; Domino is now socializing it **before** broader scale-up.\n    \n- **Positioning:** Domino framed the move as **not “now or never,”** but **easier earlier than later** (before user and project volume grows).\n    \n- **AZ priorities surfaced:**\n    \n    - **GxP-first posture** (focus the discussion on the **GxP-governed offering**).\n        \n    - **Environment lifecycle** expectations (dev → test → prod) with **pre-prod qualification** before production upgrades.\n        \n    - **Update / release mechanism clarity** (UAT window, cadence, who controls timing).\n        \n- **Outcome:** Domino will send **(1) hosting proposal & diagrams, (2) data-privacy analysis, (3) security/release/SLA docs.** AZ to review and respond. No decision taken; **next step is evidence review** against AZ guardrails.\n    \n\n---\n\n# What Domino proposed (key points)\n\n- **New deployment option:** **Domino-hosted control plane** (Domino SaaS-like) that **AZ didn’t have when first deployed**.\n    \n- **Why now:** Simpler to migrate **before** usage and complexity balloon.\n    \n- **Both models viable:** Domino acknowledged **trade-offs**; either can deliver AZ’s target capabilities; choice depends on **cost/benefit + security/privacy acceptance**.\n    \n- **Migration diligence:** Domino would run a **migration assessment** (configs, customizations, gaps, roadmap) **before** any commitment.\n    \n- **GxP variant:** Domino has a **more controlled GxP release** process vs. rolling updates for non-GxP.\n    \n\n---\n\n# AZ asks / constraints captured\n\n1. **GxP focus:** Evaluate **GxP-compliant control plane** path first (tighter change control, advance notice, timing control).\n    \n2. **Lifecycle management:**\n    \n    - AZ requires **dev/test/prod** separation.\n        \n    - **Pre-prod (test) must be GxP-qualified** prior to promoting to prod.\n        \n    - Expectation: **upgrade dev → qualify in test → AZ smoke checks → promote to prod**.\n        \n3. **Versioning & releases:**\n    \n    - **Advance notice** and **UAT window** required.\n        \n    - Clarify if **dev/test may share a control plane** (Domino suggested this is possible) **while prod has a separate control plane**, or keep all three separate—**options to be documented**.\n        \n4. **Documentation delivery:** Domino to provide **hosting diagrams, privacy analysis, security posture, release cadence & SLAs**.\n    \n\n---\n\n# Analysis: implications & risk lenses\n\n## Governance & compliance\n\n- Moving CP to Domino creates a **new architectural pattern** at AZ; requires **ISRA/PIA re-validation** and clear **DPA/MSA addendum** on metadata handling, admin access, and audit rights.\n    \n- **GxP** requirement means **controlled releases**, **qualification evidence**, and **environment segregation** are must-haves.\n    \n\n## Security & control\n\n- Need proof that **no sensitive data/metadata or secrets persist in the control plane**.\n    \n- **Private connectivity** (e.g., PrivateLink/VPN) only; **no public endpoints**.\n    \n- **Federated identity** (Azure AD SSO + SCIM), **AZ-owned keys/secrets**, and **full audit export** to AZ SIEM.\n    \n\n## Operational reliability\n\n- Domino claims **operational offload** (patching/upgrades handled by them). AZ must verify **RTO/RPO**, **maintenance windows**, **notice periods**, and **telemetry access** (dashboards, APIs).\n    \n\n## Cost & reversibility\n\n- Early migration may avoid future complexity, but AZ must confirm **actual cost deltas** (PrivateLink, DR, SIEM integration) and **a clean rollback path** if the model is not satisfactory.\n    \n\n## Strategy & timing\n\n- Domino’s argument to move **before scaling** is logical from migration complexity standpoint, but **approval hinges on meeting AZ’s GxP, security, and audit guardrails**. A **limited pilot** (non-prod or a constrained tenant) could reduce risk.\n    \n\n---\n\n# Decision framing (stay vs transfer)\n\n- **Transfer (Domino CP)** makes sense **only if** Domino demonstrates:\n    \n    1. **No data/metadata leaves AZ boundaries**,\n        \n    2. **Private connectivity**, **AZ-owned IAM/keys**, **full auditability**,\n        \n    3. **Equal or stronger** **SLAs/DR** than today,\n        \n    4. **Controlled GxP release flow** with **dev→test qualification→prod**,\n        \n    5. **Reversible migration** (documented rollback), and\n        \n    6. **Net value** (ops offload, feature velocity) **exceeds integration risks/costs**.\n        \n- Otherwise, **stay with AZ-hosted CP**.\n    \n\n---\n\n# Open questions to close (send to Domino with the doc request)\n\n1. **GxP release mechanics:** Exact **notice periods**, **qualification steps**, **customer gating**, **freeze/rollback** options, and **environment timing independence** (dev/test vs prod).\n    \n2. **Architectural diagrams:** End-to-end **network flows**, **control plane services**, **where metadata lives**, **log export paths**, **privileged access model**.\n    \n3. **Security artifacts:** **SOC2 Type II**, **ISO 27001/27701**, **recent pen-test + remediation**, **vuln mgmt SLAs**, **data residency** for CP + backups.\n    \n4. **Audit & telemetry:** **Real-time audit export** to AZ SIEM; example **dashboards/APIs** for health/usage.\n    \n5. **DR posture:** **RTO/RPO targets**, last **DR test evidence**, failover comms process.\n    \n6. **Env topology options:**\n    \n    - (a) **3 separate CPs** (dev/test/prod), or\n        \n    - (b) **Shared CP for dev+test** with **separate prod CP**—**trade-offs** and **GxP implications** for each.\n        \n7. **Migration plan:** **Compatibility assessment**, **cutover approach**, **downtime**, **fallback plan**, and **who does what** (RACI).\n    \n8. **Cost model:** CP hosting + **PrivateLink/data egress**, **DR**, **SIEM export**, **support tiers**; **showback/chargeback** visibility.\n    \n\n---\n\n# Recommended next steps\n\n1. **Collect evidence** Domino promised (hosting proposal, privacy analysis, security/release/SLA docs).\n    \n2. **Run an internal EA/InfoSec review** against your **guardrails** (the one-pager you built).\n    \n3. **Decide on evaluation path:**\n    \n    - **If positive:** Plan a **limited, GxP-aligned pilot** (dev→test only) with **explicit exit criteria** (isolation tests, audit export, release control, DR test).\n        \n    - **If gaps:** Return a **punch-list** to Domino; reassess after remediation.\n        \n4. **Prepare stakeholder slide:** “**Stay vs Transfer: Criteria & Guardrails**” (you already have this); add **timeline** and **pilot exit criteria** if proceeding.\n    \n\n---\n\n## One-slide quick recap (for your deck)\n\n**Domino CP Transfer – Discussion Synthesis**\n\n- **Why now:** Option didn’t exist at AZ deployment time; easier before scale-up.\n    \n- **AZ stance:** **GxP-first**, **dev→test qualification→prod**, controlled releases.\n    \n- **Domino to provide:** **Hosting diagrams**, **privacy analysis**, **security & SLA docs**.\n    \n- **Key risks to clear:** Data/metadata residency, private connectivity, IAM/keys in AZ, audit export, DR & release control.\n    \n- **Path to decide:** Evidence → EA/InfoSec review → (optional) limited pilot with clear exit criteria → Go/No-Go.\n    \n\nIf you want, I can also draft a short **“Thanks & next steps”** email to Domino capturing the asks and setting expectations for the GxP release/qualification flow.",

      "content": "“Today we need a clear decision on **how** we deploy Domino across tenants and **who** owns which plane. Multi-tenant data planes controlled by a central vendor-owned control plane **aren’t a standard pattern in AZ**; the closest analogue is **US SHARP – Databricks Multi-Tenant (2021)**, where we deliberately kept **vendor-owned control plane + AZ-owned data plane**, with strong isolation, logging, and IAM boundaries.\n\nI’ll show three options, the risks and controls for each, the **minimum guardrails** required if we pursue multi-tenancy, and the **validation evidence** Domino must provide. My recommendation is to **proceed only if** those guardrails and proofs are met; otherwise we default to a **per-tenant or per-BU isolation model** aligned to EA standards.”\n\n### 🧯 **DR & Operations**\n\nThis section is about **Disaster Recovery (DR)** — how quickly systems can recover from a failure.\n\n- **RTO ≤ 4h** → **Recovery Time Objective**  \n    The _maximum acceptable downtime_ after a failure.  \n    → It means AstraZeneca expects Domino to **restore service within 4 hours** of an outage.\n    \n- **RPO ≤ 15min** → **Recovery Point Objective**  \n    The _maximum acceptable data loss_ measured in time.  \n    → It means backups or replication must be so frequent that **no more than 15 minutes of data** is lost if something breaks.\n    \n\n✅ _Together:_ “If the Domino control plane goes down, it must be back online within 4 hours, with data no older than 15 minutes.”\n\n---\n\n### 🔒 **AES-256 at rest, TLS in transit**\n\nThese refer to **encryption standards** — how data is protected both while stored and while moving.\n\n- **AES-256 at rest** → “Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys”  \n    Data saved on disks, S3 buckets, or databases must be encrypted using **AES-256**, which is the highest industry standard (used by banks and governments).\n    \n- **TLS in transit** → “Transport Layer Security”  \n    Data travelling over the network (e.g., from the control plane to AZ data planes) must use **TLS version 1.2 or higher**, ensuring secure, encrypted connections.\n    \n\n✅ _Together:_ “All stored data must be encrypted with AES-256, and all data transfers must use secure TLS connections.”\n\nChanging responsibility for gxp is great \nreason for AZ to have a gxp env is that our scientist want to use domino to run analysis on sensitive data\nIf data leakkage \n\nso, what are the key questions if i need to decide between staying the same or transfer control plane\n\n###### ChatGPT said:\n\nExcellent question, Laura — this is exactly the strategic decision point Enterprise Architecture needs to help answer.\n\nYou can think of it as a **“Go / No-Go” framework**:  \n👉 Do we stay with the _current, fully AZ-hosted_ model, or  \n👉 Do we _transfer the control plane_ to Domino (vendor-hosted, hybrid model)?\n\nHere are the **key decision questions**, grouped by what matters most — governance, risk, operations, and value:\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 1. **Governance & Compliance**\n\n1. Has a **vendor-hosted control plane** ever been approved by AZ InfoSec or Enterprise Architecture before?\n    \n    - If _no_, are we prepared to treat this as a **new architectural pattern** requiring ISRA, RID, and PIA revalidation?\n        \n2. Can Domino guarantee **no AZ data or metadata** (including credentials, logs, or models) will leave AZ boundaries?\n    \n3. Are **regulatory or data-residency** requirements (GxP, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) compatible with Domino’s hosting region?\n    \n4. Who **owns compliance** if an audit identifies gaps — Domino or AstraZeneca?\n    \n\n✅ _If governance boundaries blur → stay with AZ-hosted model._\n\n---\n\n## 🔒 2. **Security & Control**\n\n1. Will the connection between Domino’s control plane and AZ data planes be **private (PrivateLink/VPN)** or require any public endpoints?\n    \n2. Who manages **identity and access controls** (Azure AD roles, SCIM sync, privileged access)?\n    \n3. How will **audit logs** from the control plane be exported and retained in AZ’s SIEM?\n    \n4. Can Domino prove security posture through **SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / pen test results**?\n    \n\n✅ _If visibility or control weakens → stay with AZ-hosted model._\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ 3. **Operational Reliability**\n\n1. Does vendor-managed hosting improve **availability or recovery times (RTO/RPO)** compared to AZ-managed?\n    \n2. Who responds to **incidents or outages** — and how fast (MTTA/MTTR SLAs)?\n    \n3. Can AZ monitor control-plane health through dashboards or API telemetry?\n    \n4. How frequently will **releases and upgrades** be pushed, and do we get prior notice?\n    \n\n✅ _If operations transparency or recovery degrades → stay with AZ-hosted model._\n\n---\n\n## 💰 4. **Cost & Efficiency**\n\n1. Does the vendor-hosted control plane reduce **infrastructure or support costs** for AZ?\n    \n2. Are there hidden costs — e.g., **PrivateLink traffic, DR replication, audit integrations**?\n    \n3. How will **chargeback/showback** be managed between BUs if control is externalized?\n    \n4. What’s the **exit strategy** if the model doesn’t work — can we revert without reimplementation?\n    \n\n✅ _If savings are marginal or reversibility is unclear → stay with AZ-hosted model._\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 5. **Strategic Value**\n\n1. Does this change enable **faster innovation or feature adoption** (e.g., Domino Nexus multi-cloud)?\n    \n2. Will Domino’s control plane support **multi-region AZ data planes** more effectively?\n    \n3. Does this unlock future benefits (e.g., GPU pooling, agentic automation, AI integration)?\n    \n\n✅ _If yes — and risks are fully mitigated — consider a pilot._\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 **Final Framing**\n\n> “We should transfer the control plane **only if** the vendor can provide evidence that:\n> \n> - Data never leaves AZ boundaries,\n>     \n> - Full audit and access visibility are maintained,\n>     \n> - DR and SLAs improve or remain equal,\n>     \n> - Governance, cost, and reversibility are clear.”\n>     \n\nOtherwise, the **current AZ-hosted model (Option C)** remains the safest, most compliant default.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to summarize this into a **decision slide** (“Stay vs Transfer — Key Questions & Decision Criteria”) ready for your meeting deck?",
