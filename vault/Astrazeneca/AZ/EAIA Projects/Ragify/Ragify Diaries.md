# Ragify Diaries

Friday 27th June:
We have a meeting where we agreed to progress with the blueprint, but some decissions needed to be made. A draft of the blueprint was provided.

Tuesday 30th June:
I share with them information about the process to request access to GenAI models (a.k.a GenAI process, https://confluence.astrazeneca.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=AIS&title=Generative+AI+Process+Guidance), and how different cloud vendors work

Tuesday 1st July:
They ask me for the diagram and I send it to them, including text with the decissions that need to be made regarding including whether they want to cover the access to the GenAI models.

Wednesday 2nd July:
Working on the blueprint. 
I have asked them who is responsible of what so I can raise the eRID.


Thursday 3rd July:
- Send them information on how to register a solution in service now

Message from Carlos>
*Regarding registering our **application in ServiceNow:** I initially registered it as a Business Application, but after some internal discussions, it was decided that we actually need a Business Service instead of a Business Application. Most of our enterprise services have been created in this way—an application service connected to the business application **Reusable AI**. Vladimir has requested the Business Service registration, it just got approved (**RITM1386020**), I will let you know when it gets provisioned.* 

***As for the roles you requested:*** 
*The IT Quality Manager resource has been requested and is now complete.*   
*System Owner: Isabell Gruebner*   
*Process Owner: Isabell Gruebner*   
*Project Manager: Carlos Nina*   
*Business Quality Approver: Isabell Gruebner*   
*Technical SME: Mario Sanger* 

*You also sent a document describing how to add new technologies to the technology catalog. Could you clarify what this is exactly the task to complete? Do we just need to add RAGify to the tech catalog SP? Is that a blocker?* 

*What about Cybersecurity?*
